Or do I just have to get there on the day that I signed up, and then leave after everything is done? (There is an option for staying overnight which is why I'm confused)  2. Why does orientation cost money? Ik it briefly explains this in the website on why there are fees, but there is no reason as to why it should cost 300+ dollars right? Is there anything I could do to lower the cost at least?  Sorry for the questions yall just a bit confuzzled. Any answer would help.

Now Oracle’s big cluster, the largest such assemblage ever built, has found a new home at UC Santa Barbara.   The low-cost, low-power, credit-card sized machines are widely used, normally as individual units or in a small cluster of several units, to explore, learn and teach computing and programming, and to perform certain kinds of research-related computational tasks.

1	2025-05-15 15:27:57	Should I fill out a petition to withdraw from one of my classes? (W on Transcript)	So context, for basically more than half of spring quarter this year there’s been two things that have majorly happened to me that’s been really affecting how much and how well I can complete schoolwork.  The first one being some of my financial information like my paypal account being compromised/hacked and having to deal with bank and financial problems that arose from that, leading to me having to deal with that tor a month and ended up deleting my paypal account. This event already sank my mental health into rock bottom and my anxiety sky high.  The second major problem being that i suffered a concussion via a bike accident in the middle of the quarter that’s had to be treated for a few weeks now. Ive had to be taken to the hospital a few times now having to deal with said concussion and the lasting effects from it, while also treating other physical injuries on the rest of my body like deeps cuts and lacerations on my face specifically. The recovery process for the concussion is especially slow and requires me to not look at screens often which isn’t ideal considering we use canvas for basically everything now. And when i do try to work for extended periods of time i usually get awful migraines that make it especially hard for me to stand or walk, causing me to vomit.  I’m mostly asking here first just to see and or clarify a few things:  1. Should i mention both issues when submitting a petition to withdraw from one of my classes or just the concussion (as it does have physical paperwork attached to it)  2. Are withdrawls counted as retakes? I’m a sophomore at the moment so I currently have zero idea of how withdrawls work or function or whatnot.  3. If I were to apply for grad school would I have to explain why a W is on my transcript, and in the same vein does it make me look bad to have a W on my transcript in the first place?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated regarding this topic, and i feel like my only three options are trying to tough it out and power through to try and make a comeback, intentionally fail and retake the class in fall, or submit a petition request like detailed above.

I understand transfers get one year guaranteed and then are on their own, so my question is how expensive is off campus normally and how hard is it to find a place?  SD and Davis both do 2 years guaranteed and since I don’t get any financial aid, does anybody know if SB’s 1/1 housing is way more expensive than the other UCs 2 years?

So you can graduate the CS major without taking, for example, computer architecture or operating systems?  Maybe even duck out of theory of computation(though ig it's still a prereq for like a dozen courses)?  I'm sure students are jumping for joy at dumping PSTAT 120B in the gutter, though I suppose students affected by the above are not even aware of the horror they have narrowly avoided.  Can anyone (meaning u/pconrad0) explain the thought process of whatever committee is responsible for these rather drastic changes?

I just visited both campuses and the vibe I got from SB was insane. I know UCR is the more sensible choice as I have a scholarship there and it's got a medschool but I couldn't imagine giving up the location &amp; ppl of SB (especially as a nature lover).  I don't think SB will be just as good as UCR for pre med because R is definitely quieter and easier to focus at, but I'm realizing people are saying it's actually really bad for premed. Mainly in terms of avoiding distractions, but also bc how limited opportunities are. I heard that pre med opportunities and hospitals are really hard to get positions at because of how many other pre meds are there, and how few hospitals there are.  I'm sure this part is at least a little true, but is it sizeable enough to give it up entirely and go to UCR?  (Also I'm from NC so I find riverside campus/area pretty nice compared to where I live now)	Is UCSB really that bad for premed Hello all I m an incoming freshman currently deciding between UCR and UCSB I just visited both campuses and the vibe I got from SB was insane I know UCR is the more sensible choice as I have a scholarship there and it s got a medschool but I couldn t imagine giving up the location amp ppl of SB especially as a nature lover I don t think SB will be just as good as UCR for pre med because R is definitely quieter and easier to focus at but I m realizing people are saying it s actually really bad for premed Mainly in terms of avoiding distractions but also bc how limited opportunities are I heard that pre med opportunities and hospitals are really hard to get positions at because of how many other pre meds are there and how few hospitals there are I m sure this part is at least a little true but is it sizeable enough to give it up entirely and go to UCR Also I m from NC so I find riverside campus area pretty nice compared to where I live now	3

1	2025-05-07 00:08:06	MS ECE 2025 admit, questions reg survival.	Hi Gauchos, especially those from the ECE department!  I'm an incoming international student to the department, but my decision to enroll is entirely contingent on how hard it is to get a TA/RA role—or any kind of employment or funding—that can make a decent dent in my student loans. This has been a lifelong dream, but I’m feeling jittery now because the current economic situation and the funding cuts are honestly pretty scary.  So here are my questions:  1. How difficult is it to get a TA/RA role in the ECE department as an MS student? From what I’ve seen in historical admit data (attached image) and the ~50 TA positions per quarter, it looked like almost everyone used to get one—until last year, when there was a big influx of admits. Is that influx going to make things harder for current enrollees? The admissions page does mention that incoming grad students are considered first, based on merit.  2. About that “merit”—what exactly do they look at for TA positions? GPA?  3. It’s surprisingly hard to find recent MS ECE students on LinkedIn (compared to other universities), even though the data shows there have been around 200 students in the past three years. Is that data even accurate?  4. Are there any decent-paying options besides these? I may even drop the plan if I don’t seem likely to get anything. Or should I take a blind leap of hope, given the college reputation?

This documentary will focus on the creative aspect of recreation, the reuse of clothes/items that people thrift, and the value of thrifting. Recreation could entail adjusting the size of the clothes, cutting, mixing and matching of clothes, adding pieces/accessories to form a costume, or cleaning old/stained/rusted clothing/items to be useable again. I appreciate any creative works that bring a new purpose to the clothes/items you thrift! If you’re in Goleta or Santa Barbara, and you like thrifting, please message me!

Does anybody have any advice on coursework I should study before starting the classes in fall? Anyone have any resources they recommend? Do professors take in masters students for graduate research positions? I've only seen them have PHD students.

1	2025-05-06 22:18:04	‼️Burning questions for UCSB student‼️	Help! I was accepted off the waitlist for ucsb (am committed to UCSD but heavily considering swapping to SB). I have a few questions that I haven’t really seen addressed much and wanted to see if anyone could help!  1. For upperclassmen mainly: I understand the campus isn’t really close to downtown sb or any truly urban areas. Have you found yourself bored now that you are older and could perhaps be over the partying/frat scene you may have enjoyed your earlier years? Is that kinda the only thing to do there or do you guys just drive to further away bars or something? And also like aside from any partying aspect, do you get bored in general like not having any close by malls or like typical movie theaters or whatever else, having been there so long.  2. Kind of going along with my previous question: does the food get old quick? If other restaurants are far away and may require a car, does it get hard to find places you enjoy eating on campus. I overall haven’t heard much about the food on campus.   3. Santa Catalina/FT dorms: I have heard that waitlist students are more likely to be placed here rather than the on campus dorms (although I have no idea the validity of that statement). For those who live there, do you find it isolating from the campus community? A big pro of ucsb for me is how everything was very close together (vs UCSD where all the dorms are very spread apart and not cohesive). So if you were placed in the off campus dorm buildings has that significantly affected how connected you feel to the school/campus. I have spoken to a girl that lives there and she said she doesn’t mind it but finds herself rarely on campus by choice like she only goes in the mornings for class and then leaves. Is that the common case?  4. The beach: I always hear the beach as a big pro of ucsb and how it‘s lovely to live right by it. I currently live in small beach town in CA and am about a five minute walk from the beach which I love. However I have heard that the Santa Barbara beaches aren’t really the type you can hang out at or swim in or lay out on the sand. It seems most people just occasionally go to watch the sunset. San Diego has beaches similar to where I am from so it is what I usually visualize when I hear “beach school” but it seems to not really be a big aspect of SB if you can’t even really go there. Have you found this to be the case? Are there beaches with actual sand to like lay out on nearby?     If anyone has anything to add regarding these things it would be a big help thanks!!

Im very of an outdoorsy person(hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and especially surfing which i go 3-4 times a week) Personally not a party person too much and im definitely much more academic. Not gonna say im vigilantly anti party but definingly on the much lesser end of that scale. Im currently leaning towards SB, just because i visited SB and not UCI, though I could maybe visit this week unofficially.  # UCSB  # pros:  * Location. More scenic, visited last month, unlike anything I’ve seen in california; mountains right next to ocean, etc. * Social life, ppl seem more outgoing and just easier overall. * Smaller class size for CS or so im told * Stronger research wise?  # cons  * party school reputation. I’m a core believer that you can find your people almost everywhere, but this is still somewhat of a factor. * farther from home(4-5hrs) * Worse surfing, somewhat of a factor for me but not defining. Its the main thing I do outside school. * isolated/industry connections, again this is a bit of a gray con. * housing crisis, goes for all uc’s but extentuated at SB. I was told that 2nd year housing should be looked at around November 💀  # UCI  # pros  * know decent amount of ppl going there, potentially have a good friend as a roomate. * Prestigiously stronger? IMO theyre both relatively the same but I thought I would include. * closer to home(1 hr) * better surfing * My dad works in irvine 3 days a week and has an apt there.  # cons  * socially worse/more inactive. Again let me reiterate that I think you can find your own ppl everywhere, but I do believe it would be harder than UCSB but idk. * Larger class size * Seems more boring than SB, i’ve read its a commuter school rather than college town. * Less Diversity, decently important to me.

I was wondering if anyone has gotten off the waitlist for CS this year and if people are admitted from time to time by major or just randomly.  I also saw that there's a place to submit transcripts but that's optional until you're accepted and decide to enroll. Would me submitting my transcript there mean that they get to see my senior year grades while reviewing my waitlist app again? (that would be a positive for me if they did.)  Lowkey really hoping I get off this waitlist.

I have in-state tuition at UCSB, and a $15,000 scholarship yearly at UMD(provided I maintain a 3.2 GPA).  At SB, I am directly admitted to Computer Engineering but at UMD I was admitted to L&amp;S(need a C- in chemistry and B- in physics and calc credits I already have to transfer). I am unable to take engineering related courses until I transfer.   As far as I can tell research, internship and career opportunities are roughly equal.   For me, my two main concerns are my classmates and peers. I know SB has a reputation as a party school and i'm not sure how true it is and how much it would affect me.  But I tend to be influenced by peers and it would help to have friends that push you academically as well.  The proximity to home is nice because I enjoy the scenery california has to offer but i've visited and would be okay with UMD, so I'd like to base the choice mainly on academic factors.   Any advice/opinions would be appreciated.

Nothing went wrong until I was trying to transfer my SEVIS record lately to my grad school and it was just now OISS told me I need at least 12 to maintain my F1 student status. It’s impossible to add any class right now so should I petition for deficit load or what? I have emailed OISS but I genuinely don’t know what else I can do now.

I wanted to make this post to ask abt the physics program here so I can better decide between the two schools in case I am somehow admitted off the ucla waitlist. Some questions for physics majors or just anyone else who has input:      1) How good are research and internship opportunities in SB? I understand that it is kinda a little far from bigger cities, so is there still a sufficient amnt of companies in the area that offer research/internship opportunities?      2) Are lower division classes large? If so, is it still possible to connect with professors? Alot of ppl say to visit during office hours to make friends w professors... what exactly are office hours like?      3)  Would it be possible to double major or minor in smth like stats/data sci? I wanna have a fallback plan in case I don't pursue grad school, so I thought having courses in smth more practical would be maybe useful for getting a job right after my bachelors.  4) Also considering trying to switch into college of engineering for mech or chem e... which is hard asf from what ive heard. If anyone has stories, advice, experience, or insight on this it would be much appreciated :)  5) Any insight at all about if there are any big differences between SB and LA for Physics!

I know Pitt has multiple research opportunities for premed and they have a great premed pathway. They also have challenging courses but the school culture is not too competitive. I love the campus and the environment but I am an out of state student so the cost will be around $60,000.  Compared to Pitt I have heard UCSB does not have much clinical research and they also don't have a med school. However, I also like the UCSB campus and I am a CA resident so the estimated fees are less than Pitt, around $47,000.   Would it be better for me to go to Pitt which has more research but is costly compared to UCSB which is closer and less costly? I know med school is extremely expensive and I don't want to start undergrad with a debt but I am also scared of not standing out because of less research and volunteering. Can anyone who has done premed at UCSB tell me your experience and if you would recommend it? Thank you!

While on a guided tour they took us past dorms filled with people playing beach volleyball and said this is a daily occurrence. While that does sound like paradise, my question is… do people actually just party and play beach volleyball all day? The way the tour guide advertised the school it made it seem like it was a very relaxed environment, and I am wondering about the academic rigor of the school. For context, when I went to UCSD to look at the campus everyone said it’s really rigorous and lowkey socially dead(lol). I’m wondering what the general work life balance is.

I recently came across the Linguistics major with an emphasis in language &amp; speech technologies.  I am pretty interested in learning about linguistics, and I'd especially like to explore the intersection between Ling and CS. Thus, I am considering double majoring or minoring in Linguistics.     Is anyone majoring in Linguistics with this emphasis? Or double majoring/minoring in CS? If so, I have a few questions!  How would you rate the linguistics classes/professors here? Any classes you particularly enjoyed?  How is the balance between pure linguistics classes and more technical/computational courses?   How well does knowledge translate between CS and Linguistics? Do courses in both subject areas better your understanding of fields like NLP/Computational Linguistics?   Would it be difficult to try to finish all of the requirements for both majors in 4 years? I have quite a few AP credits so would this help ensure this is possible/ease my course load?   Thank you!

For months since Fall, I can hear them playing video games together, which honestly I don’t care about. It’s always loud yelling but it’s a college apartment so I can’t complain on that part. What really pisses me off is them banging on their desks. One of them rages when he’s losing video games and starts slamming his door, banging on his desk like a maniac, yelling, and even bangs on the wall next to me so loudly that it shakes my entire room. It sounds like a body slamming all across the wall. This has been happening for months on end, and every time I report it to the RA, they just knock and say to be quiet. Gee thanks. To add onto that, when we pass by their apartment, it REEKS.  Please send help haha.

In the acceptance letter they stated that ""You may remain in the major to which you were admitted or select from numerous other majors available within this college. Please visit the [Major Changes page](http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/major-changes) to view those majors. Unfortunately, you will not be able to change back into your original choice major(s) at a later date. Thus, if you accept our offer of admission, it should be with the understanding that you will benefit from the Pre-Financial Mathematics and Statistics major, or another available major within the college, rather than with the expectation of changing into the major(s) to which you originally applied.""  Does this mean that there is no likelihood of me being able to change to Computer Science as my major either now or later in the school year? I was hoping to be able to attend UCSB with my accepted major and take the remaining required pre-major Computer Science courses at UCSB, then try to change my major to Computer Science.  I was also considering trying to change my major to Statistics and Data Science, as I read that it might be more closely tied to my coding background than Financial Mathematics and Statistics.   If neither of these would work, do you guys have any suggestions for how I should move forward regarding this situation? I would love to be able to continue having CS in my future, as I've been working towards a CS degree while at my cc.

1	2025-05-01 00:12:25	Should I go to UCLA or UCSB	Hi everyone! I recently got admitted as a transfer student into UCLA and UCSB! I'm super excited and grateful but I'm having the hardest time deciding between the two.  I got admitted as a gender studies major at UCLA which was my alternate choice (did TAP) while for UCSB I was admitted into communication which was my first choice. I'm honestly much more interested in communications than gender studies since even though it is UCLA, what would I even do with a gender studies degree? I did talk to an admission representative and she said I could POSSIBLY switch into sociology on orientation since I have 2/3 the requirements done (Socio 1 and stats). However I don't know if this is a guarantee and I really don't want to be stuck in gender studies.   I'm also leaning way more towards UCSB because I love the location and vibes and I'm personally not a fan of Westwood as a college town. Isla Vista appeals to me more since it has that traditional college town feel. I'm also an LA native and grew up 20 mins from UCLA so I'm a bit sick of the area. On the other hand, there's still so many places in the city that I haven't explored yet since I usually only stay within my area and school, so maybe this will push me to see the city in a different way.  Everyone around me is pushing me to go to UCLA because of the prestige and opportunities. I even talked to some of my friends roommates in SB and they said they're only there because it was a backup and they would've chosen UCLA if they could've. This would be a total no-brainer if I was in a competitive major like CS or STEM but I'm quite literally a Communication/Gender studies (or sociology) major so I don't know if that really applies to me. Is there a huge difference in opportunities given to UCSB students vs UCLA students in social sciences?  I also found clubs on both campuses that I'm interested in, but I heard that the competitive environment makes it very hard to join the good clubs/students orgs (and also transfer discrimination????) at UCLA.  TLDR; I honestly just don't want to regret my decision. I know I'd be super happy in UCSB since I already have my best friends there, but I know I'd probably be happy at UCLA too. Basically I'm torn between better vibes/atmosphere (UCSB) vs prestige, experiences (UCLA).  Sorry if this is super long, but I appreciate any help and if you read any of this!! Anything is appreciate!!

I used to often eat at DLG or portola as a guest, but did not set foot in any dining common this year until today. I don't know if this played a role, but I have long unkept hair and was dressed poorly in slippers.  tl;dr DLG staff were unprofessional and unwelcoming and did not allow me to eat even though I had a host.  I finished class and was starving, so while thinking of what to eat I came across the brilliant idea of experiencing the dining hall one last time before I graduate. I came with my friend, we did not have a meal plan, but from past experience, you could always ask someone to take you in as a guest.  I explained my situation to the front desk. Staff told me word-for-word, “the only way you can enter is if you have a meal plan.” I informed her on the guest policy and then asked a student behind me if they’d be willing to take me as guest (this is what I always did prior to 2025 and never had any issues). Student agrees, but the staff continues to deny me, saying can't count because they saw the interaction.  Now I'm just confused and bewildered, because if the school is going to make a rule on guests then there’s no point in trying to differentiate real and fake friends as long as both parties agree. note I have already identified myself as a student with a perm number and drivers license.  I asked for a manager, and when Mr. A came he repeated ""the ONLY way to enter is to have a meal plan.” I'm now getting a bit frustrated, but I \*sigh\* and repeat the policy again to the Mr. A, to which he says I needed to call my friend in order to get in, placing a lot of emphasis on it had to be a friend I could call.  I obviously think this is ridiculous, so I was trying to explain that when he became impatient and said ""I don't have time for this, I'm going to have to ask you to leave"".  WHAT? LEAVE WHERE? We were talking outside the door on outdoor school property, where would I go? It's not like I'm knocking on his front door. I also never raised my voice or acted in any way that could be interpreted as rude. I'm hungry, tired, and frustrated that I can't even eat at my own school.  So I ask for his name and said that I will email the university about the unprofessional and unwelcoming attitude. He threatened, verbatim, ""leave or i will call the police"". I am even more confused because we did not have physical contact, I was not inside the building (though I see no reason why I can't be), and every word that came out of my mouth has been polite and kind. It's funny how he talks to me like I'm the one that is being problematic.  I took a picture of his name tag, and apparently he became patient enough to actually speak with me nicely. He said I needed a host that agrees to be ""responsible"" for me and I had to stick with them the whole entire time I was inside. I made sure that was all he needed, then went to the nearest stranger, asked to be his guest, and he agreed. I think Mr. A was surprised a random person would be willing to help me out. He's still obviously unhappy about me entering, and he looks like someone just forced him to bite into a lemon.  Asides from our perm numbers, he proceeded to very intentionally inspect my drivers license (even asking for my friends passport) and have the front desk jot down a lot of information (couldn't see). Throughout this process his actions and expressions without a doubt felt very hostile and unwelcoming. Anyone could see the sourness on his face as if absolutely disgusted by letting me in.  In the end, I did get in but was in such a bad mood I didn't want to eat anything. So instead I made funny faces at Mr. A then proceeded to walk straight out.  So Am I the Jerk?"

However i’ve been hearing about a lot of grade deflation in the poly sci program at UCSB so i’m kind of discouraged to be in it. Fortunately, i don’t care what my major is as long as it yields an easy 4.0 GPA. I’m planning to attend a T14 law school, so my GPA and LSAT score are absolutely important. The easier the 4.0 for me, the better— that way i can have more time to study for the LSAT throughout undergrad. Any suggestions? I heard Sociology is pretty easy?   Also i would appreciate it if you guys could explain what kind of work you do in the major you suggest.

It’s taking a huge hit on my mental health and I feel like crap for not being able to be comfortable and live in the apartment I PAY FOR (undergrad housing). I don’t have the financial means to just request a room change and I just thought we barely have about 4-5ish more weeks left in the quarter so I was just thinking about sticking it out but I dread going back into that apartment.   I don’t know what to do, I don’t even feel comfortable sitting in the living room. Maybe the answer is obvious and I’m just being stubborn. I love the apartment itself it’s just the people that make it hard to enjoy. Idk. I’m trying yall. Even if I could just vent to someone (yes I’ve used campus resources) it helps.   Thanks for reading.

I’m currently a CCC student majoring in Business Administration and have always desired to graduate with business and receive a job within the realm of marketing.  Since UCSB and UCD don’t even offer Business Administration, I applied and got in with Communications to SB and Davis, then got in with Business Administration, Marketing for SDSU. I was leaning towards SDSU simply because I want to graduate with the title of “Business Administration, Marketing” rather than “Communications”. But, I’ve been going back and forth on prestige and whether it’s worth it to get a business degree from a Cal State or getting a “lesser” degree from a UC.  I’m also trying to figure out if Communications will even allow me to land a job in business/marketing. My ultimate goal (so far) is to work at a large company within the marketing department or work in marketing within the entertainment sector.  It’s also tough because from what I have learned so far, all of these universities are pretty similar ranking-wise and with the resources/opportunities they offer.  Also, since I’m coming in as a transfer, I’ve missed out a LOT with university student life and really want to experience that when I transfer. I’m aware that Davis is supposedly the least active in greek life, parties and similar things whereas SDSU and UCSB are more considered party schools. So this is another factor that isn’t too important but is impactful enough for me to consider.  Lastly, I’ve visited all these campuses and spoken either with my friends that attend, transfers or admissions counselors and I’m still pretty stuck on where I should go.  If anyone has advice/has been in this situation, please respond or let me know what you ended up choosing and why! And no, I am not asking for this decision to be made for me, I just want additional information about these universities and these particular departments to see if there’s anything I didn’t know or that I should be wary of, etc.  Thank you!	ucsb vs davis vs sdsu Hi I m trying to decide between UCSB UCD and SDSU on which will be the best for a business related career I m currently a CCC student majoring in Business Administration and have always desired to graduate with business and receive a job within the realm of marketing Since UCSB and UCD don t even offer Business Administration I applied and got in with Communications to SB and Davis then got in with Business Administration Marketing for SDSU I was leaning towards SDSU simply because I want to graduate with the title of Business Administration Marketing rather than Communications But I ve been going back and forth on prestige and whether it s worth it to get a business degree from a Cal State or getting a lesser degree from a UC I m also trying to figure out if Communications will even allow me to land a job in business marketing My ultimate goal so far is to work at a large company within the marketing department or work in marketing within the entertainment sector It s also tough because from what I have learned so far all of these universities are pretty similar ranking wise and with the resources opportunities they offer Also since I m coming in as a transfer I ve missed out a LOT with university student life and really want to experience that when I transfer I m aware that Davis is supposedly the least active in greek life parties and similar things whereas SDSU and UCSB are more considered party schools So this is another factor that isn t too important but is impactful enough for me to consider Lastly I ve visited all these campuses and spoken either with my friends that attend transfers or admissions counselors and I m still pretty stuck on where I should go If anyone has advice has been in this situation please respond or let me know what you ended up choosing and why And no I am not asking for this decision to be made for me I just want additional information about these universities and these particular departments to see if there s anything I didn t know or that I should be wary of etc Thank you	3

Where to go to college? ~Option A: UCSB- Stats and Data Science, got a good aid offer which is basically a full ride, but not sure about the whole tech job market and the specificity and niche major like Data Science. Many say it’ll get replaced by AI but who knows. For this reason I am not sure this is what I want to pursue as tech has been a very trendy and hard pathway to break into nowadays.(Ranked/regarded higher, unsure about major) ~Option B: CalPolyPomona- If i’d choose this school I would pursue civil engineering, with the pay being a little lower than data science I do know it is a bit easier to find a job (from what i’ve researched) since they are more in demand. I’m also getting almost a full ride and it is closer to home with UCSB being about 2 hours away. I’ve heard their engineering program is great but not sure compared to other high ranking engineering schools. —Overall, If I choose CPP i’d feel like i’m wasting a full ride opportunity from a greatly regarded school like UCSB, but at the same time I’m not so sure about Data Science as a whole. I’m fine with the major just unsure of the market and it’s job security, don’t want to spend lots of time after school to job search, however this might also lead to bigger job opportunities. I want security but also a good paying job. Data science pays more but maybe less secure, civil engineering pays well but not as much as DS but is more secure. I’m conflicted please give insight if you have any.

Against SD because of the things I've heard about the social life plus I already live here and want to see something new but I am having a hard time turning it down due to rankings and proximity to internships. I like SB for the social life, beautiful campus, and it is still a great school but it is sorta isolated and I don't know how good it is for pre-law. UCI and UCD also interest me for the opportunities/great schools for pre-law. Thoughts?

I'm leaning towards CCS, but I'm worried that I'm hurting my future career opportunities by turning down Berkeley, especially if I decide that I don't want to get a PhD/be in academia (right now I'm not sure). On the other hand, it seems like CCS will give me smaller classes, more flexibility, and more access to research.      What do you all think? Where should I go? For people with experience entering the job market in math from UCSB, especially from CCS -- how did it go, and do you think employers cared much about where you went to school?     Thanks!

I was admitted to UCSB for transfer this fall 2025 semester. I'm currently taking bio 1, physics 2 and another random GE course (bio is a GE course as my major id Data Science).   My issue here is Im doing fine in all my courses except bio and have had an extremely terrible start, after 9 weeks into the semester I dont think I'm on track to pass the semester with even a C. I plan to change the course to Pass/No Pass and leave it as that so there are no changes to my planned or in progress courses.   My GPA would be above 3.0 still, i would have completely everything I need. Not passing my one Bio course would be the only issue.  This is honestly making me extremely stressed out and need some advice if anyone can offer some. I know my admission be revoked because of this but what are the odds of that if everything else is good? Thanks for all opinions.

I’m a CA resident and incoming transfer deciding between UCSB (Econ &amp; Accounting, $43k/year) and Cal Poly SLO (Business Admin, $39k/year).  I want to work on the business side of entertainment — like film/TV financing, studio or streaming service accounting, etc.  UCSB seems to have more of a film/media scene, while Cal Poly looks pretty limited (I only saw one class related to film). That’s making UCSB more appealing, but I’m still weighing cost and career prep.  Looking for insight on:  * Media/entertainment opportunities or connections at UCSB * Internships + job access (SB vs. SLO) * Econ &amp; Accounting experience (class size, professors) * Transfer experience overall  **TL;DR:** UCSB or Cal Poly for business side of entertainment (finance/accounting)? UCSB seems stronger in film/media, but Cal Poly is cheaper. Any advice?  Thanks!!

I feel like from what I hear from my high school friends who went to other schools, they think college is nothing like what people hype it up to be. But UCSB has been everything I’ve ever wanted in college and more. I wasn’t very popular in high school, I didn’t have a lot of friends, I chose UCSB so afraid that I wouldn’t fit in. That was all gone here, I feel like all I had to do was be nice and talk to people and everyone was so open to being friends. I became more extroverted, I found a variety of groups with different interests that I liked hanging out with. If I wanted to do something, go dt, go to the beach, grab food, I could always find someone to do it with. I remember in my first few months of freshman year, it felt like I was on vacation every time I walked out of my dorm to do homework and sunbathe on the grass with friends. I’m genuinely so grateful for the environment that this school fosters and I’m so thankful for everyone I’ve met here. I know this sub can focus a little too much on the negative side of UCSB and I just wanted to share my experience, because I think this is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made 🫶🫶	I love it here and I feel like time has passed so quickly I know that people say college is supposed to be the best years of your life I feel like from what I hear from my high school friends who went to other schools they think college is nothing like what people hype it up to be But UCSB has been everything I ve ever wanted in college and more I wasn t very popular in high school I didn t have a lot of friends I chose UCSB so afraid that I wouldn t fit in That was all gone here I feel like all I had to do was be nice and talk to people and everyone was so open to being friends I became more extroverted I found a variety of groups with different interests that I liked hanging out with If I wanted to do something go dt go to the beach grab food I could always find someone to do it with I remember in my first few months of freshman year it felt like I was on vacation every time I walked out of my dorm to do homework and sunbathe on the grass with friends I m genuinely so grateful for the environment that this school fosters and I m so thankful for everyone I ve met here I know this sub can focus a little too much on the negative side of UCSB and I just wanted to share my experience because I think this is one of the best decisions I ve ever made	34

I have visited the campus twice and I absolutely love the vibes there. However, I am also considering community college for several reasons. For one, it would save me money and I am worried about putting my family in a position where they cannot afford to help pay for my college tuition.   However, if I were to go to community college I would likely try to transfer to UC Berkeley. I have several reasons behind this, one being that I have friends attending Berkeley, whereas I don't have friends attending UCSB. I know I can make friends but it's something I'm worried about right now. Another reason is that Berkeley is closer to home. I wouldn't have to travel super far when visiting home. I am also worried that I will be looked down upon for attending UCSB because it's a ""party school."" Berkeley is well known for its strong academics and I've heard that those who graduate from there are set up for life.   But with all of this mind, I still love UCSB and don't believe that it's a bad school by any means. It has a lovely social life and lots of extracurricular opportunities, which is something I really like. I'm just having a hard time making a decision because I see good and bad in both.

For context:    These past couple years have been a little rough. I switched around my major a couple times and it caused some serious delays for transferring. My home life is difficult and I’d like to get out ASAP. Between doing all these things and things I hear from others, I’ve consistently felt unworthy or unintelligent and always wanted to prove myself by doing something “more.” All this combined has taken a serious tole on my mental health, and I have been at an all time low, I didn’t really think that I’d get this far and have to make this decision to begin with.     This last year has been rather interesting, as I have become significantly closer with my best friend from high school. So much so that we have pretty much isolated ourselves from other people and developed a severe codependency (which we are actively working on). While this has some toxic aspects, both of us push each other to grow and we have become better people overall. Currently, we live together and our living styles are extremely compatible—there’s no one else I’d rather live with or spend my time with. We have grown a lot closer due to past shared experiences and trauma bonding. A concern I have with staying in CA is her being alone. Her mental health isn’t great either, and because of this, I’m worried that I won’t be able to be there for her when she needs me.     She (22F) graduated last year, currently works in corporate, and has committed to UH Manoa for a graduate program that—down the line—would be something I’d be interested in pursuing as well. We share the same academic interests and career goals, and she has been my biggest motivator in helping me decide my own path. She applied to the same schools as me because we were originally hoping to attend the same university together (me, finishing my bachelor’s, and her, beginning graduate school), but things didn’t work out. I think her guidance would be extremely valuable to me because she pushes me on a personal level, in a way that I don’t believe an academic advisor or someone else could do for me. Here are the logistics:     My stats:  * GPA: 4.0, EC’s: several relevant experiences relating to my field of interest (volunteering, internships, research, and other part-time jobs, etc.) * Interests: Surfing, swimming, water-polo, hiking, climbing, outdoors basically, foodie  * Preferences: I don’t like the city, I like a more peaceful vibe (but okay with HNL),    UHM admitted under BIOLOGY major  UHM pros:  * Living with my best friend, mental health will most likely be okay * Cost of living would be cheaper (potentially share a studio/split living costs, car) * Interesting research aspects that I would love to explore * It has been a dream of mine since a child to live there sustainably    * being there as a student, this would be the only ethical opportunity I would have (not considering living here post-grad because I want to respect the land/people) * would have the opportunity to start a non-profit with my friend, something we’ve spoken logistics about and I’d be really excited to do.    * this would be great for future job prospects * Warm ocean, great weather, biodiversity    * INSANE surfing spots (everywhere around the island, assuming we have car which we probably will) * Asian food!! Sin Cheung Yuen &gt;:) * Cultural hub * can bring my friend’s cat (that we’ve raised since 2 weeks old); otherwise, would stay with her partner in CA    * with all of our committments, it’s easier to take care of an animal with two people  UHM cons:   * not a “prestigious” university, not sure if the quality of education may match the other two and this might play into continuing feeling as if I’m not capable of something “more” * maybe not as many research labs I could take part in  * semester system, so might take me a longer time to graduate than I’d like * worried about how this might affect career things/networking because I’m interested in the environmental space and worried that the tropical/endemic environment of HI won’t translate to jobs I’d want to work in CA  * visited the campus, wasn’t super impressed but the location of the school makes up for it    UCLA admitted under ECOLOGY, BEHAVIOR, AND EVOLUTION major  UCLA pros:   * quarter system, might be great in graduating as soon as I can * I will finally get that “prestigious” standing by attending a top uni  * In CA, get california experience working in my respective field * visited the campus, more beautiful and tranquil than expected. surprised in a good way * FOOD HERE IS UNMATCHED (so many cultural options!!) * ability to start my OWN nonprofit (but not sure if I will have the time or motivation to do this myself, kind of wishful thinking but would be great for job prospects as well) * best surf friend lives near the coast, could potentially get rides with him to beach/won’t be completely alone for the most part?   UCLA cons:   * not many clubs regarding my academic interests that I’d like to join, would probably have to start my own if i wanted to * not with best friend, worried about mental health  * housing costs would be pretty expensive, city living seems expensive  * city-ish. Honestly the vibes are more peaceful than expected but still has a bustling sort of aspect to it. * food, am i gonna get fat * an hour probably from good surf spots (LA traffic)    * but kind of a PRO too because really good surf spots (Huntington, Newport area is known for this), not new to driving an hour for surfing anyway but not completely sure if I’d take my car    UCSB admitted under ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND MARINE BIOLOGY major  UCSB pros:   * still has that “prestigious” UC reputation  * quarter system so same deal with UCLA  * In CA, get california experience working in my respective field * good non profit and clubs at the school that i’d be interested in joining and being active in * on the beach, great for surfing (althought surf here isn’t the best, might have to drive out of town anyway) * location is insane: mountains, ocean—lots to do outside  UCSB cons:   * would not be with my best friend, mental health might take a toll * take with UCLA- housing costs seem expensive, isla vista is EXPENSIVE  * I don’t love the super “party” atmosphere, it’s just something I’ve sort of grown out of  * visited the campus, wasn’t as impressed with the campus as UCLA (same deal as UHM, love the location) * food options are more limited    I have all my GE’s and prerequisites required, so ideally, I’d like to finish undergrad within a year. Tuition costs are relatively the same for all schools (UHM a little cheaper), so main cost differences would be living costs.     Sorry it’s so long, but this is one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make. If anyone that’s had to make similar decisions before (or attended these universities under these majors), I’d love to know your experience with everything as well as any advice or tips. Something that worries me most about choosing CA is being alone and not having my support system nearby. I understand we can call, but it’s not really the same and our mental states have become somewhat intertwined. I also worry for her safety, as we rely on each other a lot. She is a really great friend because she pushes me to do what’s best for me, despite her fears about everything. This is why I wanted to ask Reddit, because I feel really lost and I don’t know what to do.    I’ve also thought about the possibility of attending a UC and going to UHM for graduate school; however, I’m worried about how the time away might affect both of our mental healths. I also realize this could be a good time to work on our codepency, but it just feels sort of forceful and cold turkey.

So I was admitted at UCD for Global Disease Biology and UCSB for BioPsych. Commitment day is right around the corner and I am completely unsure of where to attend.. I have been leaning more towards Davis but now I am overthinkinggg  Recently, I looked more into SB and found that they have many great pre-med clubs and support systems especially for first-gen pre-med students like myself. I unfortunately don't know about UCD advising because I have been unable to find any info. But, I am aware that UCD has student-run clinics which is a huge plus, but I wish there were more pre-med clubs, especially more organizations that are hands-on, hosts consistent panels and brings in alumni in med school, workshops, and for first-gen pre-med students. (Not saying that they only have bad ones but I noticed that some clubs only do arts and crafts activities which I find odd.) SB really seems to have that community which I really want.  Ultimately, it seems that Davis has more volunteering/clinical opportunities, some clubs, while SB has stronger club and mentorship, especially with MCAT prep and interviews.  Another thing is that I love Davis's campus and dread the idea of going to SB. I honeslty don't like SB's campus and it makes me feel empty.. But previously, I really wanted to attend SB (this was before I did any research) and I find it odd that I didn't already commit. Honestly, my biggest fear is regretting not attending SB but then I consider how I'd probably feel the same about not committing to Davis.  Last week I was set on Davis and all of a sudden I am second-guessing everything!!! If anyone has experience with any school, PLEASE let me know. I am really overwhelmed and would appreciate any insight.

I’m a very shy person and there’s this guy in my Econ 100b class that I literally cannot stop thinking about. I’m usually too scared to approach anyone first, but this guy… omg. He’s so cute. Tall, really good style, and whenever he walks by, his cologne smells SO good I swear it’s distracting lol. When he smiles at you I feel so happy and seen but super nervous! His voice…. If you know you know what I mean 😅  My best friend actually sat next to him during lecture once and she ended up talking with him a bit. She found out he’s German and Spanish, he loves traveling, and apparently Italy is like… his favorite place ever. He said he loves everything about Italian culture, which is super cute but also like… I know nothing about Italy??? 😭 I’m Swedish and Norwegian and I’m scared I’ll sound stupid if I try to talk to him about it, but I really want to make a good impression. Alsooo, I was thinking… isn’t it kind of common for German guys to like Swedish girls? We have similar cultures… I think?  Also, he seems pretty chill? Like, some girls tried to talk to him after class once and it kinda looked like they didn’t get anywhere… so now I’m even more scared because what if I just embarrass myself?? 😔 But at the same time, he and his friends seem so fun and cool, like they’re always laughing and just seem like good people to be around. They are always watching boat videos in class 🤨  Sooo… how do I go about this? Any advice on how to start a conversation without seeming creepy or awkward? We sit behind them in lecture. Also maybe like, tips on what Germans are into so I don’t sound dumb?? 😂 Thanks in advance 🥺❤️	Hottt German Guy in Econ 100b Hi everyone I feel so silly posting this because I hope he doesn t see this on here but I really need advice I m a very shy person and there s this guy in my Econ 100b class that I literally cannot stop thinking about I m usually too scared to approach anyone first but this guy omg He s so cute Tall really good style and whenever he walks by his cologne smells SO good I swear it s distracting lol When he smiles at you I feel so happy and seen but super nervous His voice If you know you know what I mean My best friend actually sat next to him during lecture once and she ended up talking with him a bit She found out he s German and Spanish he loves traveling and apparently Italy is like his favorite place ever He said he loves everything about Italian culture which is super cute but also like I know nothing about Italy I m Swedish and Norwegian and I m scared I ll sound stupid if I try to talk to him about it but I really want to make a good impression Alsooo I was thinking isn t it kind of common for German guys to like Swedish girls We have similar cultures I think Also he seems pretty chill Like some girls tried to talk to him after class once and it kinda looked like they didn t get anywhere so now I m even more scared because what if I just embarrass myself But at the same time he and his friends seem so fun and cool like they re always laughing and just seem like good people to be around They are always watching boat videos in class Sooo how do I go about this Any advice on how to start a conversation without seeming creepy or awkward We sit behind them in lecture Also maybe like tips on what Germans are into so I don t sound dumb Thanks in advance	34

From what I understand, both UCSB and UCLA have super strong econ programs, but UCLA beats out UCSB in terms of prestige. Academics aside I would much rather go to UCSB because I have a bunch of friends there and I just like the campus/atmosphere in general a lot better than UCLA. Are the two programs really all that different and is it worth giving up my plan for UCSB just for the slightly better prestige that UCLA offers?

You have a choice in deciding how much you pay for tuition. This year, A.S will collect $17,000,000(seventeen MILLION) in student fees from undergraduates. They have so much money they don't know how to spend all of it(Remember 2 years ago when they randomly rented a ferris wheel in IV? That came from student fees. Or when they hired Drag queens to perform in Storke plaza but nobody showed up? Also student fees. Or now when they're spending $50,000 to install police call boxes in IV when everyone has phones? Also student fees).  If you care about tuition or affordability take a look at the budget yourself and remember to vote. Unlike many things in the university, you have a say in this.

I'm a transfer student from a community college, and I got accepted into CCS. Right now, I'm trying to decide between going there or choosing UC Davis, which is much closer to where I live and significantly more affordable.  If you're attending CCS, could you please share your experience? I'm trying to get a better sense of what unique opportunities the school actually offers, versus what might just be good marketing. I'm especially curious about networking—do those opportunities extend beyond the local area? Are there chances to build international connections?  Also, does the school actively help you prepare for a career after graduation, or is it more of a ""you're on your own"" kind of approach with a lot of creative freedom but little guidance?"

My end goal career-wise is software engineering (data scientist as a second option). Do yall think its better for me to go for CogSci at UCLA with a Computing Specialization and a Data Science Engineering minor, or just go to SB for CS and not worry about a specialization or minor?

I also love the beach and I hear the area around Santa Barbara is beautiful but gets boring. Let me know if anyone feels this way!

I’ve never been to the area but I don’t like how it seems far away from nature I do think it would be fun to be in the middle of LA.

This is a 2 part question, where I’m trying to get a better feel of the current OFF-campus housing situation at UCSB after the first year of guaranteed on-campus housing.  1. Addressing a question about housing after the first year, a UCSB representative responded, “Housing is not a problem after their first year since students can…” get on-campus housing, university apartment complexes, or housing in IV.  Have things improved recently so that it would be fair to say housing is not a problem after the first year?  2. And I found the following regarding timing on the UCSB housing website. Would you say this is accurate for when to start searching for off-campus housing?  “You can begin your search at anytime of the year. It depends on your needs and desires. If you want housing in Isla Vista on the ocean (Del Playa), you will want to begin your search in early January for the following school year. Also, if you need a rental that accommodates more than 4 people (3 bedrooms or more), we recommend you start in early January. If you want to live in other parts of Isla Vista you can relax a little and search at your leisure in the Winter and Spring Quarter for the following school year. If you are interested in living outside of Isla Vista we recommend that you start your search 2-3 months in advance of the month you wish to begin your tenancy.”	Is housing not a problem after the first year This is a 2 part question where I m trying to get a better feel of the current OFF campus housing situation at UCSB after the first year of guaranteed on campus housing 1 Addressing a question about housing after the first year a UCSB representative responded Housing is not a problem after their first year since students can get on campus housing university apartment complexes or housing in IV Have things improved recently so that it would be fair to say housing is not a problem after the first year 2 And I found the following regarding timing on the UCSB housing website Would you say this is accurate for when to start searching for off campus housing You can begin your search at anytime of the year It depends on your needs and desires If you want housing in Isla Vista on the ocean Del Playa you will want to begin your search in early January for the following school year Also if you need a rental that accommodates more than 4 people 3 bedrooms or more we recommend you start in early January If you want to live in other parts of Isla Vista you can relax a little and search at your leisure in the Winter and Spring Quarter for the following school year If you are interested in living outside of Isla Vista we recommend that you start your search 2 3 months in advance of the month you wish to begin your tenancy	25

I was taking a look at the transfer apartments and was wondering if anyone could help me figure out the different pros and cons for each?   One big thing that I want is to be able to meet a lot of new people and have the social aspect that I missed as a freshman. I also don't plan on bringing a car with me.  If anyone has lived in the dorms as a transfer, is there any ones that you would recommend or that have more transfer students and how was that experience?  Right now, I'm leaning towards Santa Ynez but any information helps!   Thanks so much!!!

I guess my thinking when applying for this was if I am going to spend all this money on school I may as well challenge myself and go into something lucrative. I got in as a Data stats major even though I had to drop Calc 3 this semester because I got sick for a week and had too many classes on my schedule. Other than that, I have gotten at least a 92 in all my other math classes, which I am not saying to flex, but because I don't feel confident in my math skills despite this. Those A's cost me all my time and energy. I skipped meals and went to math help every school day and Sunday. I also don't know if I am passionate about math. I liked it until it kind of took over my life. I had to think abt these math classes the moment I woke up until I went to bed. Maybe I am just scarred from Calc 2 because I don't think Calc 3 was as bad, I just got too behind. I have a few questions for Data Science majors:  How many years will it take me to complete if I have only completed up to Calc 2 so far? I might be able to do Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra over the summer. How hard is the coursework past Calc 2? Does it get significantly harder? And does anyone know if the financial math has the same number of math classes as Data Science? Is this a good major for someone interested in entrepreneurship?   Thank you!

I didn’t report that I ended up dropping one of my classes.  Context: I am a double major (hist and poli sci) at my current school and the class I dropped was a poli sci class. The class will not affect my application requirements, total required units, and it is not related to the major I applied for.  I also still have (and am on track to maintain my 4.0).  I read online that I should email them immediately so I did.  But im shitting bricks right now im so scared they are going to rescind my application  Has this happened to you or anyone you know?? Will I be ok? im not gonna be able to relax until i hear back from them.  TO CLARIFY: i dropped the class within the allowed drop time so it’s not on my transcript as a withdrawal. when i applied i told them i was planning on taking it and i ended up not taking it and didn’t notify them of that change.  UPDATE: they didn’t give a fuck🥳🥳 they asked what class it was and then said it won’t affect my admission!

I don’t expect you to know much about physics at Tufts, but are there any current physics students and/or alumni who can give insight on the UCSB program (and also the housing situation)?  I’m aware about CCS, and I’ll definitely apply for it if I attend UCSB. However, I know the odds are against me, and I want to assume I’ll be in L&amp;S for the duration of college while deciding which university I want to attend.  I’m aware physics at UCSB is really well regarded for both CCS or L&amp;S, but I’m skeptical about the bigger size of L&amp;S. Tufts will have much smaller classes, less competition for research, and I should be able to create more personal connections with my professors. I feel I could stand out easier at Tufts as a result.   In L&amp;S, Im concerned about the availability of research (especially under the Trump administration) and whether the bigger class sizes means my recommendation letters from those professors will be weaker when I try apply to top grad schools. Basically, can I still get accepted to top grad school programs in L&amp;S even with the competition from CCS students?   I am also worried about the housing crisis. How big of a deterrent should the housing crisis be? I’ve heard it’s really bad.    For the record, Im out of state, so cost is similar, although a tad cheaper for UCSB.

Just a few minutes ago, I got an email listing all the A2 courses that are acceptable for COE requirements.  I know I still have time to drop the class, but I’m wondering if it’s possible to request clearance for a different A2 course instead. Honestly, there doesn’t seem to be much difference between the various A2 options anyway. Has anyone tried switching or gotten a different A2 approved?

(I'm thinking either double major CCS math or transfer to computing, but I'm not too sure yet)  2) How hard is it to pick other major's classes within CoE? Like if I want to take some EE/MechE classes is it relatively easy?  3) Is it easy to make connections with professors and do research with them? I've heard UCSB is relatively undergrad focused and provides a solid amount of research opportunities, but I'm not sure how much this applies to CS specifically.  4) How is the internship/job search as a CS major? How much does UCSB help within the internship search process (connections, interview prep, vicinity to jobs, etc.)  5) Kind of relating to #4, but what portion of your extracurriculars are ""pre-existing"" at UCSB (i.e. doing research w profs, doing stuff w clubs, etc.) vs. independent pursuits/projects (stuff that doesn't really need UCSB or any college in general to be doing)  6) What's the social scene like within the CoE/CS? I know UCSB has a good social reputation, but engineering/CS in general has a pretty terrible social reputation. I'm just curious how sociable/approachable people within my classes will be.  Sorry for all the questions!

I visited the campus about a week ago for the Open House and loved it. Met a few people from various clubs/organizations that I would like to be a part of. Seems to have good support for pre med students (I am a pre-bio major). The only thing that is throwing me a little is the party school reputation. I am not a party person and do not plan or want to become one. However, I am also a bit of a shy person and would want to make friends any way I can. Was wondering if there was anyone else in the same situation who decided to attend UCSB that can speak on how the social/party life at UCSB and if it affected their lifestyle after going to SB and if the party reputation rubs off on someone like me who would not want to be a part of that.

I got accepted into psychology at both schools and am having a hard time choosing. I always imagined myself in California and so far UCSB is my best option, I'm waitlisted at UCLA and don't know if I should consider that option as well if I get in (any advice on that would also be appreciated). I'm from a very sunny place so a concern of Washington would be how gloomy it is. I'm also from a city and thought I'd want a college town. Now that I've been to both schools I'm not sure. Washington was definitely more urban but the campus still felt like a college campus and separate from the city- it also has a more direct route home. UCSB is a car ride away from Santa Barbra and IV feels a bit small. Washington also has a stunning campus which is a huge plus. Both campuses are close to nature, just the struggle of beach v. mountain. At SB I was awarded the Regents Award which guarantees housing for four years, which I know can be a major problem. The food scene is not the most important but also something to consider, Washington has amazing variety, which coming from a city I've grown up with. While I'm focused on psychology, I have considered business as a minor. The UC's don't offer a business major, but do offer economics while Washington offers Business Administration. I'm not set on business, and I realize I can also pursue an MBA with a psychology undergraduate degree. One last thing is partying. I'm social and do like going out but I'm not big on drinking or staying up super late all the time. I know SB has people who aren't huge partiers as well, but something to consider. I know college is a time to grow and explore new things but right now I'm feeling very anxious. Any advice will be very much appreciated!!	University of Washington vs University of California Santa Barbara I m a high school senior currently choosing between UW and UCSB I got accepted into psychology at both schools and am having a hard time choosing I always imagined myself in California and so far UCSB is my best option I m waitlisted at UCLA and don t know if I should consider that option as well if I get in any advice on that would also be appreciated I m from a very sunny place so a concern of Washington would be how gloomy it is I m also from a city and thought I d want a college town Now that I ve been to both schools I m not sure Washington was definitely more urban but the campus still felt like a college campus and separate from the city it also has a more direct route home UCSB is a car ride away from Santa Barbra and IV feels a bit small Washington also has a stunning campus which is a huge plus Both campuses are close to nature just the struggle of beach v mountain At SB I was awarded the Regents Award which guarantees housing for four years which I know can be a major problem The food scene is not the most important but also something to consider Washington has amazing variety which coming from a city I ve grown up with While I m focused on psychology I have considered business as a minor The UC s don t offer a business major but do offer economics while Washington offers Business Administration I m not set on business and I realize I can also pursue an MBA with a psychology undergraduate degree One last thing is partying I m social and do like going out but I m not big on drinking or staying up super late all the time I know SB has people who aren t huge partiers as well but something to consider I know college is a time to grow and explore new things but right now I m feeling very anxious Any advice will be very much appreciated	3

I was accepted to UCSB CCS for math as a regents scholar, and if I go to UCSB I'd do it hoping I would be a shoe in for a top math grad program when I graduate (ofc I know I will have to work hard).   My other option is my state's college (UConn) which is decent and way cheaper, but I fear I wont get into a great grad program if I choose UConn. These are my only 2 acceptances sadly  So Q1: Is my impression of CCS correct in that it is a good grad school feeder?   Q2: If I am talented enough to get into CCS, would I be able to stand out (even if I dont attend CCS) if I maintain my passion and work ethic?

My goal is to major in ChemE and work in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry—possibly in medical devices, drug development, or anything bio-related where ChemE applies.  I've read that UCSB’s ChemE program is especially well known for its work with semiconductors and materials science, which is awesome, but I'm wondering how well the program translates to other industries like biotech/pharma. Here are my questions lol:  1. Are there research labs, internships, or job pipelines at UCSB that support that kind of path?  2. Will a ChemE degree from UCSB still be seen as prestigious and strong if I'm using it in a biological or pharmaceutical context?  3. Do students from UCSB ChemE often go into biotech, or is it less common compared to other industries?  I also got into UC Berkeley, and I know it has stronger ties to the Bay Area biotech scene. Would this path be significantly easier/more viable from Berkeley in terms of connections, research, or reputation? I like Berkeley (recently visited the campus) but scared I won't really stand out and struggle to find opportunities given that most of my stem experience is purely in academics (AP's) and i'm not really sure how I got in .  Any advice from current students, grads, or people in the field would be really appreciated!

"UC Santa Barbara will be tackling some of the issues around ethical use and practical applications for the ever-changing machine learning landscape when the Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice (CoP) hosts the AI Spring Symposium “AI in Action: Insights from the UCSB Community” on Zoom April 28th through May 2nd.   Daily sessions, which take place virtually and are open to anyone, will tackle topics like chatbots, AI in clinical medical practice and college students’ use of ChatGPT. The event organizers aim to create a space where people can ""be skeptical and be inquisitive together"" about AI, said co-organizer Lisa Berry.  For 2025, the AI Community of Practice has teamed up with the Department of Communication’s biennial Rupe Conference, which focuses on the social implications of mass and digital media. “This year, we have more presentations that are focused on teaching and learning and the ways that university students interact with genAI,” said Berry. “I think the topic is very well aligned with our mission to look at both the ways that people are using AI, but also the academic research about it.”  Accompanying links:  https://otl.ucsb.edu/cop/artificial-intelligence-community-practice (Registration)  https://otl.ucsb.edu/ai-cop-spring-symposium-2025  Published April 16, 2025"	The second annual AI Spring Symposium will be held on Zoom April 28th through May 2nd UC Santa Barbara will be tackling some of the issues around ethical use and practical applications for the ever changing machine learning landscape when the Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice CoP hosts the AI Spring Symposium AI in Action Insights from the UCSB Community on Zoom April 28th through May 2nd Daily sessions which take place virtually and are open to anyone will tackle topics like chatbots AI in clinical medical practice and college students use of ChatGPT The event organizers aim to create a space where people can be skeptical and be inquisitive together about AI said co organizer Lisa Berry For 2025 the AI Community of Practice has teamed up with the Department of Communication s biennial Rupe Conference which focuses on the social implications of mass and digital media This year we have more presentations that are focused on teaching and learning and the ways that university students interact with genAI said Berry I think the topic is very well aligned with our mission to look at both the ways that people are using AI but also the academic research about it Accompanying links Registration Published April 16 2025	22

I spent nearly all day doing research on this school today, however, and have come across a higher volume of stories, mostly on this very subreddit, of instances of homophobia and racism at this school, compared to the other UCs I've looked at so far. So I just had some questions, and I'm mostly looking for answers from mlm and Asian students, but any minorities in general.   1. How many years have you been here and how many times do you feel you've experienced some form of microaggressions or harassment based on your race/sexuality/disabilities?  2. How is Greek life for minorities? And for those who **are** minorities and **not** part of greek life, how has that impacted your social life/ability to attend parties (specifically for males)?   3. Do you feel safe/comfortable/able to be yourself at most parties? In class?  4. How often do you hear racial/homophobic/ableist slurs and attitudes/rhetoric?  5. Have you ever been made to feel alienated or different (in an isolating sort of way)?  6. Is it common for students to tolerate bigotry among their friends to avoid conflict?  7. How is the gay scene in general? Friends, clubs, bars, dating, etc? Especially for mlm  8. Would you feel comfortable standing up for yourself if you were harassed? Would you expect to be defended by the school/other students if harassed or if you had to defend yourself physically?  9. How are professors who are minorities, especially those with accents, treated/talked about by students?  10. If you've been here multiple years, do you think the school is heading in the right direction in regards to these questions?  So those are my questions, and please answer them truthfully. I'm not yet married to going to this school, and the answers to some of these questions are going to be dealbreakers for me. I'd rather know now what kind of place this is before dedicating any more thought to it.     Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this and answer!

I’m really hoping to live in a 1B1B double, but I’m worried that by the time it’s my turn, those units might already be full. So, I’m wondering if anyone else is also looking to live in a 1B1B double and doesn’t yet have a confirmed roommate—and preferably has an earlier housing selection time. If so, I’d love to connect and see if we might be a good match!  I'll be in my 3rd year for the 25-26 school year and l'm an international student in Chem major. I study often and I am a quiet person but very talkative once you get to know me.  Also, I don’t bring friends back to the dorm, and I’d really appreciate it if you could do the same. I prefer to keep our shared space quiet and private. I’d really like to keep our dorm drug- and smoking-free.  If you want to room together or just be friends，pleace let me know！	Looking for a roommate for undergrad Apartment I just received my housing selection date for the 2025 2026 academic year but it s a bit late on May 22 I m really hoping to live in a 1B1B double but I m worried that by the time it s my turn those units might already be full So I m wondering if anyone else is also looking to live in a 1B1B double and doesn t yet have a confirmed roommate and preferably has an earlier housing selection time If so I d love to connect and see if we might be a good match I ll be in my 3rd year for the 25 26 school year and l m an international student in Chem major I study often and I am a quiet person but very talkative once you get to know me Also I don t bring friends back to the dorm and I d really appreciate it if you could do the same I prefer to keep our shared space quiet and private I d really like to keep our dorm drug and smoking free If you want to room together or just be friends pleace let me know	36

How hard is the work, do you often feel overwhelmed despite putting in lots of work? How good are the research opportunities? Being located near UCLA and Caltech, is it feasible for a ucsb student to get a position there? How is the job market from UCSB? Specifically in tech. Lastly, I know UCSB is a party school, but for physics specifically, are people mostly education focused?  Anyone who isn’t a physics major feel free to respond, I’d love to hear about your experience at UCSB too!

1	2025-04-18 04:29:26	Fee elections are rigged	I was reading through the proposed initiatives and their statements are literally only pro statements. [https://studentlife.sa.ucsb.edu/units-initiatives/campus-elections](https://studentlife.sa.ucsb.edu/units-initiatives/campus-elections)  This alone is stunning. Imagine if Congress tried to pass a bill that added a pro statement for only Republican candidates. People would rightfully be outraged. Even in the most controversial of California's state proposition elections, both sides of an issue get a fair representation in their voter guides. The greatest irony is that A.S receives pro statements for spending measures from the people who are funded by these measures. Counseling submits pro statements for counseling, Health and Wellness submits pro statements for Health and Wellness, EOP leadership submits statements for EOP.  It's especially worsened by the fact that we are all students. Many of us don't have the time to keep up with all the commissions and proceedings of our student government. We just see an election email once a year, spend a few minutes filling out the online voting form, and forget about it until the results come out. I mean who wouldn't? We're all busy people. The pro statements all sound pretty convincing and we may feel good supporting a laudable cause like Mental Wellness or Academic Services.  To be clear, I have no beef with these programs. I think many are cool and understand why people support paying fees for them. I just don't think it's fair to make all students pay more tuition for services if they never use them. Tuition is going up every year and student expenses are becoming unaffordable. Wouldn't it make sense to lower spending instead of driving tuition costs further up?  It may very well be that these programs are positive measures and that our students will benefit from them. But we will never get a fair vote to decide this, because the organizations supporting the fee increases will always win.

1	2025-04-18 03:09:41	Kind of lonely	Just wanted to make this to vent I guess.   I’m a first year and I’ve been having trouble making friends here at ucsb. I’ve been doing better mental health wise, though I’m still struggling to connect with others. I’ve mostly made friendships that only last the quarter, and life feels pretty lonely. I use to be pretty good at going to club meetings and events on shoreline, but lately I’ve sort of given up or gotten lazy with that.   I know I can be better and more outgoing honestly. I’m pretty introverted but I still want connection. Doing a bit of reflecting, I could definitely do more to try and make friends, like talking to others in lecture and going to clubs more often. I think sometimes I’m just too scared to go up to people and strike up a conversation. I also just feel like I’m not fully enjoying ucsb, even though this is a once in a lifetime sorta thing. This has been making me feel guilty lately, and I wish I was actually happy here.   I guess I also wanted to make this post to see if anybody else was feeling lonely or wanted to connect. Incase anybody wants to connect over these things, I’m an environmental and global studies double major. My favorite bands are Nirvana, Pink Floyd, and CAKE. I like photography but I’m pretty bad at it, reading books but I don’t really read often, and growing plants.

I am a chemistry major, but I'm contemplating changing to physics later on. I live about an hour drive away from UCI and two hours away from UCSB, but I don't really think the distance matters that much since I don't plan on going home every weekend regardless of which one I go to.  UCSB pros:  the beach  more social life + more school spirit  slightly stronger physics major...?  UCSB cons:  kind of secluded town  party scene could be overwhelming since I don't consider myself much of a party person  UCI pros:  overall school atmosphere is more academic oriented  potentially more research opportunities  close to LA and might be easier to get access to get internships and etc  slightly stronger chem major...?  UCI cons:  lack of school spirit + maybe more stressful environment?  lack of social scene  less racially/ethnically diverse  Overall, I prioritize academics and employment opportunities, but I don't really think there's that drastic of a difference between the two, hence why I'm struggling a lot. Ultimately, I guess what I'm trying to ask is, are there any factors that I did not consider that might help me make a decision?

Academically, both schools are ranked about the same for EE so I’m not too concerned about that aspect, so basically the decision is just up to the college experience and the campus. I visited both campuses and both have positives and negatives that I just can’t weigh so I’m asking in both subs.  Irvine: +So first up I loooove Irvine’s campus. The way it’s a circle is really fun, I love the greenery, and everything being so organized and clean is a big plus to me. Middle Earth also blew me away the first time I saw it. Campus sorta reminds me of Monster’s University lmao (don’t ask me why) -As soon as you walk out the campus though, it seems like (to me, at least) just a boring suburban city (albeit a damn clean city) with not too much to do. Newport beach is 15 mins away, but idk if students go there a lot.  SB: +From what I’ve heard, the college experience is great here and there’s a lot of stuff going on always. Most dorms have ocean view or they’re a  30 sec walk from the beach which is great bc I love the beach. SB also has a college town which significantly contributes to the whole college experience thing. The city of Santa Barbara is also very nice, I always enjoy visiting it. I do wanna learn to surf if I go to SB. -Although I am trying to be more social and active w/ events and stuff, I’m not much of a partier/drinker and I don’t smoke/do drugs. Also the campus (apart from the beach) really did not blow me away and the buildings and layout and stuff seemed very boring and uninspiring to me.  I do, contrary to others, enjoy large classes/lecture halls w many many people so idk if that’s a factor that is relevant w these two schools. I also don’t know what the Armenian scene looks like at either school so if yall can fill me in on that that would be great. Is there anything else I should know to make a more educated decision? Thanks in advance	Deciding between UCI and UCSB for EE Hey all I m trying to decide between UCI and UCSB as an electrical engineering freshman I m an Armenian guy and I def wanna join the ASA so there s that Academically both schools are ranked about the same for EE so I m not too concerned about that aspect so basically the decision is just up to the college experience and the campus I visited both campuses and both have positives and negatives that I just can t weigh so I m asking in both subs Irvine So first up I loooove Irvine s campus The way it s a circle is really fun I love the greenery and everything being so organized and clean is a big plus to me Middle Earth also blew me away the first time I saw it Campus sorta reminds me of Monster s University lmao don t ask me why As soon as you walk out the campus though it seems like to me at least just a boring suburban city albeit a damn clean city with not too much to do Newport beach is 15 mins away but idk if students go there a lot SB From what I ve heard the college experience is great here and there s a lot of stuff going on always Most dorms have ocean view or they re a 30 sec walk from the beach which is great bc I love the beach SB also has a college town which significantly contributes to the whole college experience thing The city of Santa Barbara is also very nice I always enjoy visiting it I do wanna learn to surf if I go to SB Although I am trying to be more social and active w events and stuff I m not much of a partier drinker and I don t smoke do drugs Also the campus apart from the beach really did not blow me away and the buildings and layout and stuff seemed very boring and uninspiring to me I do contrary to others enjoy large classes lecture halls w many many people so idk if that s a factor that is relevant w these two schools I also don t know what the Armenian scene looks like at either school so if yall can fill me in on that that would be great Is there anything else I should know to make a more educated decision Thanks in advance	3

I always make sure to lock it up securely, and had three separate locks on it—but the thieves still managed to cut through all of them.  I'm honestly pretty heartbroken—it was not just transportation, but something I relied on daily. I'm posting in case anyone may have witnessed something, seen the bike around, or has any information about who might be responsible.  If you've seen a silver RadRunner Plus or anything suspicious, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’ve already reported it to UCPD, but any tips or help from the community would really mean a lot.  Thanks so much.

If you or someone you know experienced this sort of harm in the 1970s or earlier and the school failed to act or actively covered it up, your story could help support this survivor’s pursuit of justice.

1	2025-04-15 20:47:59	Which UCSB dorm should you choose	I put these in the order I would choose based on me being a pretty social person who likes to go out. I’m a first year now and I based this off of how easy it will be to make friends, location, and the vibe of the dorm. I hope this helps someone bc I was really confused when deciding last year.   1) Anacapa &amp; Santa Cruz The most social and fun dorms. People love it here. I haven’t heard of them being so crazy that you can’t sleep, but can still get pretty rowdy. They are most accurate to what you’ve probably heard abt freshman dorms/seen online (the drinking/partying/ect)  2) Santa Rosa Pretty similar to anacapa and Santa Cruz, maybe just a little quieter. I live here and love it. It’s super fun while also never getting too crazy. I can study in my dorm/sleep well while also being able to have friends over. I will say it has less hall camaraderie and might be slightly harder to make friends than anacapa or Cruz.   3) San mig &amp; nic Also kinda like the past 3 but quieter and more introverts than the others. Ppl still have fun here and like it, but it’s definitely not as fun. You can also smell the lagoon if you have ur windows open sometimes.   4) FT Super social and ppl who live here are super close and build great friendships. It’s super fun. The location sucks ass tho and most ppl end up barely going to classes. The bike is so annoying and I’ve only done it once. Busses are always super packed and sometimes a wait.  5) manzi/anything else I had a friend the lived here and she said the ppl who lived here were either second years, super introverted, or just really strange. I don’t want to be mean, but her random roommate never said a word to her other than hi on the first day, but would growl at her consistently. She was able to find very few outgoing/fun ppl here. The location also was pretty inconvenient. Cabrillo is a lot better than DLG tho.   Other suggestions:  Don’t pick the room next to a bathroom, you can hear the toilets/showers. I don’t have any problems next to a stairwell.   Try to get first floor, it’s so much better and you will get tired of the stairs quickly.   Get roommates you think you can live with well not your best friend ever. I know a lot of ppl who are miserable because they chose someone they got along with well, but didn’t figure out what kind of roommates they are. The  rich/popular/cool roommates that so many ppl I know chose ended up being high maintenance, messy, annoying, and inconsiderate. I chose based on things like how clean we are, how we want to run our room, how considerate they were, and what they care about and now they’re my best friends.   Get the lowest meal plan, the food sucks and it’s impossible to get myself to go even 6 times a week. You can upgrade easily if it ends up not being enough.   Decide desks/storage/beds before you arrive. Bottom bunks main storage should be mostly under the bed with a few things hanging in each closet and maybe a basket.   Don’t shop for a whole new college wardrobe before you come. When you get here the style/clothing needs will be different than you thought and you will end up wanting to buy different stuff once you get here.

At slo i know it’s great opportunities, and i liked the campus but the town itself and the lack of diversity was a huge turn off. Also love the whole hands on thing. As for ucsb, i got in for data science but would be trying to change into compE (longer road.) With ucsb, i liked the diversity and city, but the campus felt kinda dead to me. But im a fan of the social life.  I wanted to be near la but idk anymore, i just hate how far slo is from everything. But it’s such great opportunities and the campus beat ucsb for me.

I went to both campuses and I liked them both. I've heard that this place has better research and UMD has better job opportunities but I'm hearing tons of conflicting opinions.

Many of us turned down going to schools like UCI and UCLA specifically to go here. Those of us in this sub love UCSB. We are obviously going to recommend UCSB to you.   99% of responses in these threads are positive to UCSB and recommend it. So genuinely, why are you posting this? We get a billion posts like this a day and TBH it gets to a point. It *feels* like a lot of people posting because they ""can't decide"" just want to flex their college admissions on reddit or want karma or something similar.  If you want information there are way better things to ask than ""please compare these colleges with UCSB"" when most of us don't really know much about the other colleges you're asking us to choose between. Why don't you ask us specific questions about the quality of our academic departments, or our student life, or Isla Vista / Goleta, or our other programs? Please come prepared and actually do research yourself so you have precise, targeted questions to ask which will yield non-generic responses from us. There are posts like this, but they are far less frequent compared to the average ""choose for me"" post.  You should be getting specific information about the colleges you're thinking of going to, comparing the pros/cons yourself, and *then* making *your own informed comparisons*. The point is that you do the thinking part yourself and actually get specific information about specific questions you have. This is way better for you than lazily asking us to do all the thinking for you, all the while the information we give is going to be 1) generic, 2) unlikely to give you substantial knowledge, and 3) pretty much universally positive to UCSB.  So please, if you're thinking of posting ""help me choose between UCSB and (insert other colleges)"", do more research first and come back when you have questions to ask that will actually yield information for you."

I got admitted into UCSB as a freshman for mechanical engineering program for this fall, but I've also been considering going to CC and transfer to save money. It was my original plan before getting accepted since we have a difficult financial situation, so now I'm a little conflicted. I'd be paying around $11k a year.  I've had people tell me that transferring into engineering programs is difficult, but I'm fully aware and ready to work hard for the 2 years in CC. I didn't do as well as I could have during highschool + didn't have much time for extracurriculars related to my major since I was busy working, so I thought CC would be like a fresh start. I ended up applying to UCs without putting much effort into my application (I wrote all my piqs in like 2 hours without revision) and I'm lowkey regretting it. Transferring is more appealing to me but some have said that I would be throwing away a good opportunity.  I also went to a guided tour and the campus was beautiful! I loved the scenery and the weather but I couldn't see myself staying there for four years. This might just be nerves tho.  Just wanted to know if it's worth it to commit? Would love to know more about the academics, social life, how the engineering program at UCSB is and how it compares to other universities, pros/cons, etc. If anyone who graduated from there could give me some insight I would appreciate it :)	how is the mech engineering program I got admitted into UCSB as a freshman for mechanical engineering program for this fall but I ve also been considering going to CC and transfer to save money It was my original plan before getting accepted since we have a difficult financial situation so now I m a little conflicted I d be paying around 11k a year I ve had people tell me that transferring into engineering programs is difficult but I m fully aware and ready to work hard for the 2 years in CC I didn t do as well as I could have during highschool didn t have much time for extracurriculars related to my major since I was busy working so I thought CC would be like a fresh start I ended up applying to UCs without putting much effort into my application I wrote all my piqs in like 2 hours without revision and I m lowkey regretting it Transferring is more appealing to me but some have said that I would be throwing away a good opportunity I also went to a guided tour and the campus was beautiful I loved the scenery and the weather but I couldn t see myself staying there for four years This might just be nerves tho Just wanted to know if it s worth it to commit Would love to know more about the academics social life how the engineering program at UCSB is and how it compares to other universities pros cons etc If anyone who graduated from there could give me some insight I would appreciate it	39

What are some recommendations for living on campus and transportation to classes etc?   2) Pre-major: How is this major? — I know that if I get in it’s likely to end up with more resources for accounting firms, but is there any other career paths? should I consider minoring?  3) Summer courses&amp; recommended courses!

A few quarters ago somone at portals took my id away for letting my friend use it for meal swipes and I had to go buy a new one. Out of curiosity today I asked one of the dinning hall workers who wasn’t in uniform so I assumed they were management or something why you’re not allowed to let your friends use swipes out of curiosity. I was super polite and never even indicated that I’d broken the rule before but she immediately agent from being pretty nice to super rude with me after I asked that question and basically gave me the non answer of because that’s the way it is and you’re stupid for wasting my time asking me about it. But my question was just WHY is that the rule? Like why do they care if it’s the same amount of swipes being used? The difference in the amount of food I eat vs a friend is marginal so it’s not like they’d loose money. What’s the big deal? Why you gotta run the dinning hall like it’s Germany in the 40s?

I’m aiming for grad school in something like plasma physics or fusion energy, so I want to make the best choice for research and preparation. Here's my current thinking:  **UCSB**   Pros:  * Close to home. * Strong physics reputation, even though it’s through the College of Letters &amp; Science.  Cons:  * Housing isn’t great- its standard I think. * Santa Barbara feels a little isolating—might get “trapped” without much to do compared to bigger cities. * Slightly more expensive, though UC price differences aren’t huge overall. * I applied to CCS (College of Creative Studies), but I’m not confident I’ll get in. I know I can apply later, but I’m unsure how realistic it is once I’m already there.  **UCSD**   Pros:  * I visited for Triton Days and loved the campus. * My assigned housing is really nice. * San Diego seems to have more going on—potential for internships or research opportunities? * Slightly cheaper than UCSB.  Cons:  * Physics program isn’t as highly regarded as UCSB’s. I know undergrad physics is pretty standardized, but still wondering if this matters. * The huge student body makes me worry about getting research opportunities or building close friendships—is it harder to feel a sense of community?  **UCI**   To be honest, I don’t know much about it yet—planning to tour soon.  Pros:  * Regents Scholarship ($6k/year + perks). Nice bonus, but not a game-changer.  Cons:  * Campus and location seem less exciting than UCSD. * Physics program doesn’t seem as strong as UCSB’s.  thank you for the help!	help me decide for PHYSICS UCSB vs UCSD vs UCI Regents trying to decide between UCSB UCSD and UCI for undergrad physics I m aiming for grad school in something like plasma physics or fusion energy so I want to make the best choice for research and preparation Here s my current thinking UCSB Pros Close to home Strong physics reputation even though it s through the College of Letters amp Science Cons Housing isn t great its standard I think Santa Barbara feels a little isolating might get trapped without much to do compared to bigger cities Slightly more expensive though UC price differences aren t huge overall I applied to CCS College of Creative Studies but I m not confident I ll get in I know I can apply later but I m unsure how realistic it is once I m already there UCSD Pros I visited for Triton Days and loved the campus My assigned housing is really nice San Diego seems to have more going on potential for internships or research opportunities Slightly cheaper than UCSB Cons Physics program isn t as highly regarded as UCSB s I know undergrad physics is pretty standardized but still wondering if this matters The huge student body makes me worry about getting research opportunities or building close friendships is it harder to feel a sense of community UCI To be honest I don t know much about it yet planning to tour soon Pros Regents Scholarship 6k year perks Nice bonus but not a game changer Cons Campus and location seem less exciting than UCSD Physics program doesn t seem as strong as UCSB s thank you for the help	3

We play every Wednesday night in Alice Keck Park Memorial Garden at the stone circle from 4pm to about 7pm.  We welcome clawhammer banjo players, fiddlers, mandolinists, ukuleles. We only play old time music. Examples include cross-over favorites like Whiskey Before Breakfast, Teatotaler's Reel, and old standbys like Yellow Rose of Texas, Soldier's Joy and tons more. We play in unison without bluegrass-style ""breaks"" so it's fun for everyone.   This is great music, easy to learn, and we are welcoming to people who want to learn the music but are afraid to make any mistakes. Don't worry! Half these guys are deaf anyway and the rest are making their own mistakes.  We have a website with some audio and video files of us playing in case you want to see what it's like.

My only hesitation with UCSB is that I think the social life might be too much for me. I am introverted but not completely antisocial. I do love to go to parties but maybe not at the caliber of IV/UCSB. I also feel fomo whenever I miss out on something, even if it's not something that I want to go to. I'm afraid that if I go here I will either constantly be feeling fomo or be forcing myself to go to parties that I don't want to go to so that I don't miss out. Are there people at UCSB who go to one party a week max, if that, and don't miss out on anything or feel judged?

UCSB doesn’t release admissions until the 23rd of April (really stupid), but if I did get in I would have the hardest time deciding between the two school.  I really like the area of Santa Barbara, as I’ve lived near by my entire life (Ventura County) and my friends who already attend UCSB would let me in on a house in Isla Vista (would be a lot of fun). I’m not particularly a party person. I love the atmosphere of Isla Vista though and me and my friends would plan on making music and doing live band shows in Isla Vista.  As for SLO, I have maybe two friends that attend that are already with their own groups, so I’d be making new friends from scratch right off the bat. I’m not sure how the music scene is in SLO compared to UCSB, but I do know that Engineering is a bit better there, as the learn by doing philosophy is sought after for jobs after graduating.  I am also interested in getting a Masters degree of some sorts, potentially in electrical engineering, biomedical, or mechanical.   Is it okay to go to UCSB for the fun factor? Could I still pursue a hobby in music at SLO?   EXTRA: for life wise I would really like to live in Santa Barbra, so advice on engineering jobs in the area is also helpful.

1	2025-04-11 23:33:58	Is it worth considering everything?	Idk if it is right for me to write about this to a UCSB dedicated subreddit but whatever. I got accepted to UCSB recently but I am an international student which means no financial aid so COA is really high. I got accepted to pre-biology and want to go to dental school after that. I'm not sure if UCSB if a good option for pre-med. I also got accepted to ASU (which is not hard at all) and they offered me a scholarship so I will be paying almost half the price that I will be paying in UCSB. If we talk about price wise ASU is obviously a better option plus they have a dedicated pre-dental major but UCSB is my dream school even though it will be so expensive and kinda hard to find my way in pre-med. Plus, being a beach person, I don't want to be stuck in Arizona if I am being honest. But in case there is an economic crisis in my country (I am from a 3rd world country let's say) exchange rates to dollar would be so high that COA in UCSB would be a huge issue.  I would like to hear all opinions about this. Considering you and your friends experience, is UCSB worth all the hassle? Is it worth taking the risk? Good for pre-med? Let me know everything!

I got accepted to UCSB and waitlisted at UCSD. My goal was Berkeley but I stupidly applied for the Haas business school when i should have applied for econ (and i got rejected). If I go to my local community college, I can do one year and then have the ability to transfer to USC (my all time dream school).    I am a finance and stock market fanatic who is interested in a related job one day. I have heard really mixed opinions about UCSB and I know basically nobody there. However, I know many people at UCSD and I know the campus is a great fit for me. I hope I can learn more about the life at UCSB from some of you guys!   If I get off the waitlist at UCSD, I won’t consider cc and I will just go there. But if I am between UCSB and cc, then I might just choose cc. The problem is that it is not GUARANTEED that I can get into USC after a year, but it is highly likely. My cc is Santa Monica College and it has a super good transfer rate. Also pretty big side note: if I stay here and do cc I already have a ten month internship at a company that does business as Morgan Stanley that would last exactly 10 months from September. So I would be working and doing cc at the same time.  The truth is that I really don’t want to stay home another year. I love my parents so much, but I just don’t feel like Im developing as I am super in my comfort zone. UCSB would throw me out of that and it might be a good idea.    Thank you so much! Also please let me know the opportunities for people who like finance at UCSB. I hope to hear from some econ majors and any others at this school.

I’ve reduced number of committed options to these two unis: University of California, Santa Barbara: 80k$/year (Mechanical Engineering) and San Jose State University (Mechanical Engineering): 45k$/year (without possible merit-based scholarships) due to high difference of the Cost of Attendance. My priorities (from the highest to the lowest) are internships, rankings &amp; academics, researches, social life (also important!). Both universities are ABET accredited for my program, but I’m going to do double major in Engineering &amp; Physics (UC Santa Barbara &gt;&gt;&gt;) and opportunities to work out of US are also important (brand name mb…). Money is important, but only in the context that this university worth it or it’s just paying extra for nothing. So, what do you recommend me choose? Thank you in advance! *Also it’s very important for me to pick college with whom it’s easier to obtain F1 visa (I’m not from first-world country)	UCSB vs SJSU Mechanical Engineering International Student Hello everyone I m an international student who got in several universities in US I ve reduced number of committed options to these two unis University of California Santa Barbara 80k year Mechanical Engineering and San Jose State University Mechanical Engineering 45k year without possible merit based scholarships due to high difference of the Cost of Attendance My priorities from the highest to the lowest are internships rankings amp academics researches social life also important Both universities are ABET accredited for my program but I m going to do double major in Engineering amp Physics UC Santa Barbara gt gt gt and opportunities to work out of US are also important brand name mb Money is important but only in the context that this university worth it or it s just paying extra for nothing So what do you recommend me choose Thank you in advance Also it s very important for me to pick college with whom it s easier to obtain F1 visa I m not from first world country	3

TLDR; basically i will have a lower GPA compared to others and won't be taking as much relevant coursework as an engineering major, is it even worth considering the pre law track and if so how should i approach it as a competitive applicant?	am i stupid for considering a pre law track as an engineering major recently ive gotten increasingly interested in pursuing the pre law track but i dont necessarily want to give up my engineering undergrad track or switch majors bc i still find the skills i will obtain from it to be useful in the future or i might consider going into tech in the future im considering maybe a humanities minor since a double major would be incredibly difficult to balance with my current engineering curriculum while i know ppl tend to defend their major amp everything ive taken both engineering stem and humanities classes at ucsb to know that humanities classes are much easier in the sense that it usually doesnt have 70 80 of your grade dependent on 2 3 exams subsequently my GPA will suffer in comparison to if i was a full on humanities major i also tend to perform well on humanities courses and always enjoyed writing got a couple of awards before so i do somewhat have the skills for it ppl that major directly in history polisci english any other more pre law track majors would have an upper hand GPA wise and even relevant coursework wise ive seen a lot of ppl from solid liberal arts colleges have 3 8 GPA as pre law track majors and i just cant help but feel that im foolish and stupid for considering this path bc i prob cannot compete at that level TLDR basically i will have a lower GPA compared to others and won t be taking as much relevant coursework as an engineering major is it even worth considering the pre law track and if so how should i approach it as a competitive applicant	39

I am currently in my third year at UCSB as a pre-comms major, having just transferred here in Fall 2024 from CC. Today I was informed that I was not accepted into the full Communications major due to the fact that I did not meet the GPA requirement. For context, I took 2 of the pre-comms courses at CC and received an A in both classes, leaving me to take COMM 1 and COMM 89 here at UCSB. I took COMM 89 in the fall and unfortunately got a C, and just took COMM 1 this past winter quarter in which I not only got a B+, but ended with an 89.5% in the class. I had absolutely no clue that UCSB does not take into account any pre-comms courses taken outside of UCSB (my fault entirely), leaving me with a 2.65 GPA.  I am having an incredibly hard time processing the idea of having to start all over with a new major especially with the timeline I have given myself to graduate, and am trying to go through my options before I completely give up on Comms. In my COMM 1 class, I already contacted my TA weeks ago about rounding up my grade, but was rejected, however I have yet to speak directly to the professor about appealing my final grade in his course. He was an incredibly understanding and accommodating professor, and I have a few instances in which I believe the TA was not entirely fair or qualified in terms of grading and that I might be able to make a decent case as to why my grade should be rounded up 0.5% to an A-.  If by chance by professor then agrees to adjust my grade, it would put me at a 2.85 GPA, and while that does not meet the full Comms major GPA requirement, it does allow me to submit an appeal for my rejection into the full Comms major, as anything below a 2.85 GPA is completely disqualified from making an appeal and no exceptions are made.   It is important to note that during the quarter in which I received the C in COMM 89, my stepdad passed away which caused me and my family a lot of grief, and forced me to travel home multiple times throughout the quarter to visit my stepdad before he died and for his funeral. If my professor is able to round my grade up to an A- and I have my 2 A's in my pre-comms classes from CC, while explaining that my only low pre-comms grade was during a quarter where I lost a significant loved one, I feel like I have a decent case for an appeal into the full Comms major.  If this plan does not work, my only other backup is to attempt to get a retroactive drop in the COMM 89 course that I got a C in and try to retake it for a higher grade, but I would much rather go without the W on my transcript and have to retake it, and I'm not even sure I'd be approved for a retroactive drop. Does this seem completely farfetched or has anyone experienced anything similar and it worked for them?

1	2025-04-09 01:40:11	Be aware: UCSB SCV staff entered my dorm and stole $8k worth of jewelry	Hi everyone, I’m a grad student living in San Clemente Villages (SCV), and something happened recently that I still haven’t fully emotionally recovered from — but I’m sharing it here because I don’t want anyone else to go through the same thing silently.  A couple weeks ago, a housing cleaning staff member — who has been working in SCV for **years** — entered my room without permission using a staff-issued fob. I was home at the time, waiting for her to finish cleaning the common area, and she walked straight into my bedroom. Later, I discovered that several pieces of my jewelry were missing — items worth around **$8,000**.  I immediately contacted my RA and asked if they could help identify the staff member. I was told that was “out of scope.” Housing said they had forwarded the request to someone else, but I never heard back. So I went out myself to look for her and eventually found her sitting calmly in the laundry room office. I called the police right away, and they arrived within minutes.  After searching her, the police recovered my stolen items. They later told me she was involved in **many other cases** and had **thousands of stolen items** in her possession. I was incredibly lucky to get my things back — but it made me wonder how many other students may have lost items without even knowing.  Right now, I’m still waiting to hear from Housing Services and the university about what steps will be taken to address this.  I’m sharing this because I don’t want anyone else to feel the fear, stress, and helplessness I’ve felt these past few weeks. If you live in SCV or any UCSB housing, I strongly suggest double-checking whether any of your valuable items have quietly gone missing. This wasn’t a one-time thing — it was part of something bigger.  If you’ve experienced anything similar, or have ideas on how to raise awareness or push for better safety measures, please reach out or comment. No one should feel unsafe in their own home. And no student should have to go through this alone.

I live in the Plaza Lofts in IV, about a 5-minute walk or bike ride from campus. You’d be living with my current roommate. He’s a very kind and studious Physics major. Despite being right in the heart of IV, the apartment is incredibly quiet and is mostly home to grad and PhD students, making it a great spot for anyone who values an academically focused environment.  The apartment has its own spacious, fully equipped kitchen, and there’s a shared laundry room on the same floor. It originally came unfurnished, but I’ll be leaving all the furniture behind—including a bed, desk, chair, large external monitor, bookshelf, cleaning equipment, and more. We also have our own large whiteboard mounted on the wall. There’s also secure bike storage available in the building—if you bike to campus.

I’m an admitted student for the class of ‘29 and I’m still weighing the options for which college to go to, but ucsb is one of my top choices. I’m really struggling to decide if I want to go to ucsb, since there are really great pros but also some big cons for me. I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice.  Cons: - expensive: as an out of state student, my estimated price is 85k 🥀 price is definitely a consideration but because this is a pretty rigorous institution, I believe the cost could be worth it - far: I’m from MA so CA is on the opposite side of the country so visiting family would be more difficult and CA has a very different culture than the north east, so I was wondering if any of you could speak on that. I’m worried about the more laid back lifestyle, if that makes sense, since New England is I feel more always on the go whereas when I visit the west coast it’s more slow? - big party school: I love to have fun and go out, but I’m not a drinker or looking for hook ups. A lot of people have said it can be hard to navigate ucsb without being deep into the party culture, so I was wondering what that’s like - housing crisis: since it’s already so expensive, having to look for housing will also be hard after the first year - questionable pre med opportunities: I’ve seen posts saying that it’s hard to get clinical experience. Clinical experience is critical to getting into medical school, so I’m a bit worried about that. However, the pre med program in general is great and I believe there are volunteer opportunities Pros: - near the beach/ nature: I love to hike and bike and enjoy nature. I also love to visit national parks and I’m a very outdoorsy person in general so I’m really excited for the opportunity to explore california  - ranking: by ranking, ucsb is technically higher than the other schools I got into (except waitlist schools). Education is very important to me, so the fact it has a pretty good ranking (#7 public school) is compelling - opportunity to experience something else: as I’m going into medicine, I understand my work life balance won’t be the best and college is really a time for me to enjoy myself and see other parts of the country, since I anticipate going back to MA for work, unless I really enjoy CA  Also: I’m visiting in late April, so if any of you have recommendations for things I should look at/ ask about, please let me know!

I recently failed Chem 1B winter quarter (due to some familial issues that resulted in me going home a lot to take care of my younger siblings) and am currently retaking it right now for spring.   I’m pretty behind in regards to classes and am pretty worried about it, it’s looking like I won’t be able to graduate in two years at all, looking more like three years. I’m already 22 so thinking about such a long time left to even get my bachelor’s really gets to me.   Here is my current schedule for summer session A and am planning on enrolling in classes for summer session B to try to get as much as I can done during the summer. I was really hoping to get others’ opinion to see what they think of this schedule and just give me different opinions. Just sucks with how behind I am in regards to classes so please please let me know what you guys think and if you have any pieces of advice.   Thank you so much.

Does anyone know how realistic it is to get in? I didn’t apply for the priority deadline because I didn’t know it existed, so I’d either apply now or in my first quarter there. In addition, is there that big of a difference between L&amp;S physics and CCS? I want to go into grad school for a bit of context. Thanks!

Unfortunately, I didn’t get into many of my top options for college and so now I have to do a lot of last minute research into the colleges I did get into. I had a few questions based on what I’ve heard of the school and I was hoping Reddit could help me out  First, I’ve heard a lot about the students at UCSB not being the brightest. People have told me classes aren’t that challenging and that it’s a party school above all. I know UCSB has a reputation as a party school, but I was wondering if it was really that bad. I want to go to school somewhere that I’m going to be academically challenged, if that makes any sense.   Next is cost. UCSB is not that cheap and I can’t access the scholarship portal unless I enroll, so is it easy to get scholarships or to do anything to make school cheaper?  Finally, I’ve heard a lot about housing being impossible to find and super expensive.   Please help me out!!

Each club will have a tier rating for overall experience and a recruitment difficulty rating.  Tier rating will be on a S-F tier system with S being highest, and recruitment difficulty ratings will be Hard (5-10% acceptance), Medium (30-50% acceptance), and Easy (50-100% acceptance).  All of this comes from my personal experience or people who I am friends with and between us we're involved/interacted with all of these clubs.  Enjoy.     **Consulting Clubs:**  **180 Degrees Consulting (S Tier, Hard):** Strategy consulting for local non-profits and small businesses.  Definitely doing the most comparable work to actual management/strategy consulting and very good placements.  Not all of their members go into consulting, but if you want to go into consulting, they're the best club to join and even their who don't recruit consulting seem to break into top tier places.  They seem a bit cliquey and their recruitment process is definitely intimidating but worth it if you get in.    **Gaucho Creative (B Tier, Medium):** Marketing consulting that used to work with big tech companies but now works with local businesses.  Keep in mind that for consultants their acceptance rate is going to be on the lower end of the medium spectrum.  I would have put them higher tier wise but since their founder left they haven't been able to get the same caliber client as before.  Definitely a cool club that is doing some great projects, but the marketing focus limits the professional development/recruiting ability that a club like 180 has.  **Ascend Consulting Group (D Tier, Easy):** Product consulting for startups, launched very recently.  Definitely not as developed as 180 or GC but they have a lot of potential to grow.  Right now the consultant experience is not that worthwhile but again I think in a few years they'll be in the same realm as 180/GC.  Their board is a cesspool of ATO/ATO affiliated people which imo will limit them but not a horrible thing (see below).  **Consult Your Community (F Tier, Easy):** lmao  **Investment Management Clubs:**  **Investment Advisory Committee (S Tier, Hard):** Manages \~$300K as a part of Associated Students.  To get in you either need to be an ATO brother or pretty smart.  In all seriousness, they have the best work quality and technical capabilities, which is why you'll frequently see their members winning stock pitch competitions hosted by other schools.  Some really great placements as well even though they don't give support/training for recruitment.  **Dean's Investment Group (C Tier, Medium):** Manages \~$500K on behalf of the school.  Don't let the AUM fool you however, they aren't close to IAC in terms of actual work product.  An econ Professor oversees the group and they have a decent advisory board, which is why their experience ranking is as high as it is given their work quality itself is much lower.  Also note that you have to complete the SIP extension program before applying, so mostly made up of juniors/seniors that aren't able to stay with the portfolio as long as the cracked freshmen who end up becoming the PMs in IAC.    **Anyone Can Join Clubs:**  **Women in Business (A Tier):** Obviously only for girls, but a great club nonetheless, they get some great speakers for their panels.  Would be S Tier but took one off as I feel general members could use a bit more support, but very hard for them to do given how large the club has grown.  The exec board is very involved with a lot of the clubs above, so joining WIB to help with recruitment for other clubs could be very worthwhile.  **Finance Connection (A Tier):** Same comment as WIB for why they aren't S Tier, but a great club nonetheless.  Their workshops are great, especially IBW.  The IAC/FC/IBW boards are all pretty much controlled by the same group, so same note as above for joining FC to have a better chance at IAC.  **Investment Connection (F Tier):** Honestly don't know what they do but doesn't seem to be much.  Their members always gas up their IC experience on their resumes only for it to turn out they didn't do half the shit they said so they don't recruit well into other clubs.  Don't really see a reason to join but free exec position if you were unsuccessful recruiting for some of these other clubs.  **Final Thoughts:**  1) It's much easier to recruit for the top tier clubs (other than GC and DIG) if you are in ATO or a sorority.  Even 180 which historically had been meritocratic let in a bunch of ATO guys and sorority girls in the fall.  Nothing you can really do about it, just the way it's been for a while.  2) The top clubs are run by the same group of people.  I already mentioned the IAC/FC/IBW boards p much all being the same, but even the consulting club boards (primarily 180) are very tight with IAC/FC.  They all talk about recruitment (not final decisions or anything but if you shit yourself in an IAC interview, 180 is going to know about it etc etc).  3) People go extremely hard for recruitment for the top clubs so no matter how prepared you think you are, prepare more.  I would say building relationships with members of the club you want to join is a must now.  Personally if I had to recruit again I would find people on Linkedin who are in multiple top clubs and reach out to coffee chat them as they will generally be the most involved and as a result have the most influence on recruiting decisions.

I ended up applying to a coop since that was realistically the most financially affordable of all my future housing options, but I sadly didn't ger it 😭  I also ended up looking around Tropicana to see how that would work out, but everything ended up being crazy out of my range as well.  I'm now back in talks with someone with moving in for the next year, but my main concern really is finances and the distance from campus even with help from financial aid and the bus.  Overall my situation isn't absolutely the worst it could've been I'm grateful to even have a shot at somewhere to stay. I'm just worried that I might not even be able to afford the initial down payment 💀 thanks to everyone though for the kind messages and support on my previous post. Ig the biggest lesson i took from this is to take initiative and don't rely on housing contracts on campus for somewhere to stay, and to do my own stuff early.  If anyone has anymore ideas or answers as to how to deal with finances off campus or living off campus without a car, it'd help a lot!

I am still undecided on which campus to apply for though, some things I would prioritise are: cost of living, student life, transport, and ease of travel to other cities/regions. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice/recommendations based on the above.  Also, before I go on exchange I must complete 'module matching'. I don't know if there are any bio majors who could help me out here. I must take equivalent modules to the ones I would take at home. Does anyone know if UCSB would have equivalents to the following during winter/spring semesters: respiratory physiology, endocrine physiology, experimental physiology, the brain and motor control.  Thanks!!

I've been admitted to the Masters program w/ thesis at Georgia tech and UCSB, and would like current/past students' perspective on which college would be a better fit for my interests. For context, I'm a current EE at UIUC with a background in RFIC design, and want to pursue a masters to deepen my knowledge in both narrowband (RF) and broadband (wireline/optical) analog IC design. My goal is to land an internship at a chip design company over the summer, and then go into industry after graduation--I'm not sure about pursuing a PhD as of now.   From my research,   * GeorgiaTech is highly ranked (#4 in EE according to USNews) and is a reputable university, but lacks well-known advisors/professors working in my field of interest. Hua Wang used to be there, but he recently left for Europe. The coursework offered still seems to be excellent, especially the tape-out class. Cost &lt;= 80k, 1.5 years.  * UCSB is an excellent graduate program, with professors including James Buckwalter and Mark Rodwell who are big names in the field and have a strong publication record at JSSC etc. The coursework seems great here as well, with more options in high-speed IC design, and also includes a tape-out class. However, the ranking in comparison with Gatech is low (which doesn't matter to me, but if it affects employability and my chances of landing a good internship then it matters). Cost &lt;= 75k, 1.5 years. In CA so closer to SD/SF industry, and great weather.   From the perspective of current/past students at either of these universities, and other graduate students in chip design, what would be a better decision to make? If my goal was to gain hands-on research / circuit design experience and move to industry after graduating, should I choose UCSB which has better advisors or GeorgiaTech which has a higher ranking?  Additional questions:  \- can someone share anecdotal experiences of getting hired at chip design companies like Qualcomm/apple/mediatek etc from UCSB?  \- what's the cost I can expect to pay for rent if I want a 1BR or a studio?  Any input is appreciated, thank you so much :)	MS in ECE for RF AMS IC Design UCSB or GeorgiaTech Hi everyone Reposting here from r gradschool I ve been admitted to the Masters program w thesis at Georgia tech and UCSB and would like current past students perspective on which college would be a better fit for my interests For context I m a current EE at UIUC with a background in RFIC design and want to pursue a masters to deepen my knowledge in both narrowband RF and broadband wireline optical analog IC design My goal is to land an internship at a chip design company over the summer and then go into industry after graduation I m not sure about pursuing a PhD as of now From my research GeorgiaTech is highly ranked 4 in EE according to USNews and is a reputable university but lacks well known advisors professors working in my field of interest Hua Wang used to be there but he recently left for Europe The coursework offered still seems to be excellent especially the tape out class Cost lt 80k 1 5 years UCSB is an excellent graduate program with professors including James Buckwalter and Mark Rodwell who are big names in the field and have a strong publication record at JSSC etc The coursework seems great here as well with more options in high speed IC design and also includes a tape out class However the ranking in comparison with Gatech is low which doesn t matter to me but if it affects employability and my chances of landing a good internship then it matters Cost lt 75k 1 5 years In CA so closer to SD SF industry and great weather From the perspective of current past students at either of these universities and other graduate students in chip design what would be a better decision to make If my goal was to gain hands on research circuit design experience and move to industry after graduating should I choose UCSB which has better advisors or GeorgiaTech which has a higher ranking Additional questions can someone share anecdotal experiences of getting hired at chip design companies like Qualcomm apple mediatek etc from UCSB what s the cost I can expect to pay for rent if I want a 1BR or a studio Any input is appreciated thank you so much	3

Initially, I had planned to study Computer Science, but didn't get accepted into it. I've been waitlisted from UCI and UCSD for CS and don't want to place my bets on them.   I was doing some research on the Pre-stats &amp; DS major at UCSB, and saw that it didn't offer many CS courses, and was more like a Statistics major, which raised the question for possibly transferring into other universities such Mathematics of Computation (which from what I've seen is more CS oriented) at UCLA, CS at UCI, and even CS here at UCSB from the IVC/OCC (my local community colleges) honors program.

Can t decide on where to go UCSB vs CC In State Major Pre stats amp DS I m an upcoming freshman who got admitted into UCSB as a Pre statistics amp Data Science major Initially I had planned to study Computer Science but didn t get accepted into it I ve been waitlisted from UCI and UCSD for CS and don t want to place my bets on them I was doing some research on the Pre stats amp DS major at UCSB and saw that it didn t offer many CS courses and was more like a Statistics major which raised the question for possibly transferring into other universities such Mathematics of Computation which from what I ve seen is more CS oriented at UCLA CS at UCI and even CS here at UCSB from the IVC OCC my local community colleges honors program I m in a predicament because my parents are against me transferring as they know that it isn t a 100 chance that I will get into these majors which is something that I m also slightly concerned about and would rather be safe and commit here Please let me know what you guys think and how I should approach this situation If anyone is willing to explain more through DMs it would be greatly appreciated	39

I'm really interested in applying for Family Student Housing at the West Campus Apartments, but I have a bit of a unique situation and was hoping to get some input. My husband will be doing his PhD at UC Davis, so he won’t be able to live with me full-time. That said, he’ll be staying with me on weekends and holidays. Family housing would really help us have some consistency and time together during my PhD. AFAIK priority is usually given to families who live together full-time — does anyone know if there’s any flexibility for situations like this? Would we still be considered eligible?  Any insights or personal experiences would be super appreciated. Thanks so much!

How’s the CS department and the overall MSCS course structure? I’ve heard great things so far, but I’d love to know what it’s like for exmaple when it comes to choosing between the thesis and project tracks. Is it difficult to find a professor willing to supervise a thesis or project?  Also, how common is it to get TA/RA positions as an MS student? And does choosing the thesis or project track make it easier or harder to get those opportunities?  I’m also curious about the graduate housing situation - how competitive is it, and would you recommend applying for it or looking off-campus?  Lastly, I’d really appreciate any advice you have for someone who just got in—anything you wish you had done earlier or differently when you received your admit? :)  Thanks in advance!

I've been accepted into UC Davis' B.S in Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning, and UCSB's B.A in Geography - GIS Emphasis, and I'm having a hard time deciding which program I should enroll in. I'm leaning towards Davis, mainly because it makes the most sense for me and the COL isn't as high as SB, but I have also heard great things about their Geography program. I want to work in urban planning or an adjacent field after graduation, so I'd like to hear about how graduate's employment opportunities are, as well as the overall enjoyability of the program. Financial aid isn't really a concern since I got the same amount of aid from both schools.  A pros and cons list I made.  # UC Davis  **Pros**  1. Close to home 2. Proximity to Sacramento and San Francisco 3. Interdisciplinary curriculum (policy, environmental science, planning) 4. Can minor in GIS 5. Walkable and bike-friendly campus and city 6. Lower cost of living  **Cons**  1. I don't like Central Valley weather (kind of a dumb reason to not choose a school) 2. I feel like EPAP is too broad if I plan to get a masters in planning 3. Not much to do in Davis  # UC Santa Barbara  **Pros**  1. Geography can be useful in a lot of fields and can be used to get a large variety of jobs 2. Excellent weather and beautiful natural setting 3. Walkable and bike-friendly (though not as much as Davis) campus and city 4. Kinda close to LA 5. Can minor in Poverty, Inequality, and Social Justice, or Spatial Studies 6. Generally outgoing student body  **Cons**  1. Far from home 2. Isolated 3. Lacks policy coursework (and I probably won't be able to handle a double major) 4. High cost of living (especially housing) 5.

1	2025-04-05 08:02:26	‘Twas the night before Deltopia	"And all through the floors Not a creature was stirring Not even the neighbors   The alc was prepped on the counter with care In hopes that the RA wouldn’t go there The undergrads nestled all snug in their beds While the weed killed neurons inside their heads My roommate with her boyfriend, and I on the couch Had just smoked a bowl and hotboxed the house  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the couch to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of some drunk girls from SLO Gave a lustre of midday to objects below, When what did meet my wondering eyes Was a fleet of cops and eight tiny frat guys, All had been caught sitting drunk on the curb They’d pregamed too early, the time was absurd. And though they all looked and sounded the same, The cops had their info and called them by name:  ""Now, Josh! now, Luke! now Ethan and Sam! On, Chris! on, Ryan! on, Ryder and Dan! Get on the ground! Hands behind your head!” But these little dudes quickly fled.  As a scared flock of pigeons suddenly flies So fast ran these men, these tiny frat guys; Their arms flailed wildly, their legs flew As they ran from the cops, their frat brothers too— And then, still high, my body so warm, I heard the shrill cry of the fire alarm As I drew in my head, and was turning around, I saw the failed munchies that had triggered the sound Tater tots burned still there in the oven, Four hours later at 425° for a dozen There was no fire, but the smoke was black It crept through the kitchen from front to back The tots—how they burned! I’m high, this is scary! This new strain is making me wary! Out from the oven the smoke did flow And the noise from the fire alarm did seem to grow  When I opened it up and grit my teeth, And the smoke, it encircled my head like a wreath; It got in my face, my lungs, my beer belly That shook when I coughed, like a shot made of jelly. I’m chubby and plump, I realized to myself, I need to use those weights I have on the shelf. Thinking about food, I remembered the tray in my hands I set it on the stove and turned on the vent fan.  I spoke not a word, and finished my cleanup So that early tomorrow I could be up. I reset the fire alarm, silencing the noise And, back on the couch, thought of the girls and the boys That I’d kiss on DP tomorrow morning; Off to sleep I drifted, softly snoring. But I heard them exclaim, those frat guys in their plight—  “Happy Deltopia to all, and to all a good night!”"	Twas the night before Deltopia And all through the floors Not a creature was stirring Not even the neighbors The alc was prepped on the counter with care In hopes that the RA wouldn t go there The undergrads nestled all snug in their beds While the weed killed neurons inside their heads My roommate with her boyfriend and I on the couch Had just smoked a bowl and hotboxed the house When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter I sprang from the couch to see what was the matter Away to the window I flew like a flash Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash The moon on the breast of some drunk girls from SLO Gave a lustre of midday to objects below When what did meet my wondering eyes Was a fleet of cops and eight tiny frat guys All had been caught sitting drunk on the curb They d pregamed too early the time was absurd And though they all looked and sounded the same The cops had their info and called them by name Now Josh now Luke now Ethan and Sam On Chris on Ryan on Ryder and Dan Get on the ground Hands behind your head But these little dudes quickly fled As a scared flock of pigeons suddenly flies So fast ran these men these tiny frat guys Their arms flailed wildly their legs flew As they ran from the cops their frat brothers too And then still high my body so warm I heard the shrill cry of the fire alarm As I drew in my head and was turning around I saw the failed munchies that had triggered the sound Tater tots burned still there in the oven Four hours later at 425 for a dozen There was no fire but the smoke was black It crept through the kitchen from front to back The tots how they burned I m high this is scary This new strain is making me wary Out from the oven the smoke did flow And the noise from the fire alarm did seem to grow When I opened it up and grit my teeth And the smoke it encircled my head like a wreath It got in my face my lungs my beer belly That shook when I coughed like a shot made of jelly I m chubby and plump I realized to myself I need to use those weights I have on the shelf Thinking about food I remembered the tray in my hands I set it on the stove and turned on the vent fan I spoke not a word and finished my cleanup So that early tomorrow I could be up I reset the fire alarm silencing the noise And back on the couch thought of the girls and the boys That I d kiss on DP tomorrow morning Off to sleep I drifted softly snoring But I heard them exclaim those frat guys in their plight Happy Deltopia to all and to all a good night	27

1	2025-04-05 03:22:09	UCSB vs UMiami vs Cal Poly	Please help me decide where to go. Any experiences from students at ucsb would really be appreciated. These are my options:  1. U Miami 2. UC Santa Barbara 3. Cal Poly SLO  I’m from California. I received a full tuition scholarship to UMiami for like $65,000 a year, so all I would have to pay for there is basically housing/living expenses.  UCSB and Cal Poly I’d be paying like half tuition plus housing, but honestly, with the cost of living in miami being super high all 3 schools are similar in cost and the difference isn’t too drastic. Miami would be the cheapest though still.  I am a business/finance major. UCSB does not have a business school, so I’d have to major in Econ there, which I’m not too excited about. But UCSB probably has the best social life out of all those 3, and the location is awesome. I really vibed with the campus when I went there.  Cal Poly is a safe and good option for my major, and also not too far from home.   I am slightly worried about having to move across the country and being completely alone with no family, but I do love the city of Miami.  The most important aspects to me are job placement/career opportunities, and social life, I want to be able to make lots of friends and network well. I’m an outgoing person. I value a good “college experience”.  I’m really struggling to decide, and I don’t have much longer to. I’d appreciate any insight or advice, thank you!

I know it’s not a very high gpa to achieve, but in my defense, I’m a transfer and I completed a majority of my pre-major courses at my cc. I didn’t completely miss the mark, my pre-major gpa is around 2.4 and my overall is about a 3.0.   I honestly just don’t know what to do right now. I went to a letters and science advisor, they told me I had to speak directly with the PSTAT department. Went there, they told me to speak with a Letters and Science advisor. I’m going to speak with an advisor again, but I don’t have high hopes.

There was a group (more than one) of men calling a woman the n word. And the woman was screaming. I heard it in my room and went to the window to check after I heard it. But before I can see anything the voices moved to the direction of IV and soon disappeared. Did anyone else saw/hear the same thing? Is she ok?

1	2025-04-03 07:18:01	Stay away from D63 Property Management	I wanted to make a PSA for IV residents and UCSB students looking for housing. The D63 Property Management company is run by slumlords (primarily Richard Doherty and Erin Eliza) who will milk you for every last penny if given the chance with zero regard to your own well-being.  In September, out of last minute need, I signed a lease for a 1-bed 1-bath going for $3550, intending to make it a triple. This was eventually achieved, despite unprofessional discourse and intimidation from the landlords.   This February, we put in a maintenance request after our own equipment failed to fix a clog in our shower drain. D63 sent 2 plumbers the next day, who gave up after half an hour and said they’d contact a specialist. After this, D63 ghosted us for TWO WEEKS despite repeated maintenance requests on their website and official email. Only after we started posting time stamped photos and using legal terminology did they send a second guy, by which time black sludge was filling the shower base. He fixed it in less than an hour. Now, they’re attempting to charge us close to $300 for said maintenance! They’re also ghosting us on inquiries about an out of date lease document (missing 3rd tenant’s name) and a deeply flawed mechanism on their website that doesn’t allocate payments.  The Dohertys have a history of intimidating their tenants, including suing one for defamation AFTER she already beat them in court for zoning violations (https://www.independent.com/2021/07/07/big-isla-vista-landlords-taken-down-for-filing-false-defamation-suit/).

Primarily asking to understand which engineering program will be better for me. The most important aspect for me is opportunities (internships, research, career fairs?). I know that UCSB has a smaller class size and its going to be easier for me to do research and other stuff while I'm there. But based on what I'm seeing, UC Davis has a bigger engineering school (and is also close to SF and is in Sacramento, not sure if this makes a huge difference in terms of opportunities?).  Also, I've heard that UCSB has a major housing crisis for those not living in the dorms. I've even read stories where people couldn't graduate in time because of this (not sure how real this is).   I also want to know if recruiters/employers view graduates from these schools differently. I think both of them have around the same prestige but I'm not sure. I live in a rural town, and there are a few people from California here. They said that UC Davis is more heard of.  However, their opinion might be inaccurate as they haven't been to California for a while.  Opinions from current engineering students would be really helpful.  Thank you for taking your time.

I just got accepted to UCSB for political science, however i’m hearing from many sources that the poli sci program at UCSB has some grade deflation and it’s actually very hard to get an A/A+ in many of the classes.   For reference, im aiming to attend a T14 law school after undergraduate. I'm also aiming to get no less than an A+ in every class I take throughout my undergraduate years. Therefore, I obviously want to have the easiest pre-law major possible so that I can achieve thjs goal.   So which major is typically the easiest at your school? Poli sci? Philosophy? Sociology? Psychology? English? History? Anything at all!

Here’s what’s important to me in a school:  As for Major: I was accepted for pre-Econ at SB, Real Estate at UW and IU.  - ideally, I’d like it to be close to, and/or in a major city. I’m a huge concert fan and love to go out, so being close to a major city would be super helpful for me. (My parents are possibly open to letting me have a car)  - Social life is very important to me, so I’d love to hear how that fairs at any of the schools.  - I plan to go into a career in business (I’m thinking along the route of real estate or development but I’m open) and am ideally interested in working in Chicago after graduation, but any major city would be cool.  - I love to ski and would love to be able to go skiing so being close to a ski resort or good local mountain would be a perk.  - I like cold/rainy weather but I have never lived in it so it would be great to know people’s opinions on that for some of my colder schools (IU and Seattle). I still am okay with warm weather, I just despise humidity 😭.

As someone who dates men, I get the feeling too. But something I’ve noticed in all of this is the most important factor that many do not consider! Yea so the population here isn’t the biggest for a variety of gay men. But out of the gay men here, which is the most prominent population in IV and on dating apps? The answer: Bottoms.  No shade to my bottom queens out there. But unfortunately from user experience, there is a larger population of us which makes it harder to find someone of preference. Don’t believe me? Okay well go on Tinder, or Hinge, or Bumble and tell me what you see the most. And I can reassure you the tops on there are not the ones you’re looking for, or in other cases, you’re not what they’re looking for. The Top population in Isla Vista is undeniably small; with most of them either being older than 45, DL, or looking for a white twink. And most of them are not on dating apps, other than the basic hookup apps like Grindr or Sniffies.  That’s what makes it so hard for the lgbt population at UCSB to have a normal dating life here. It’s not that we’re unwanted or ugly (cause I’m definitely not), it’s just that we’re all looking for the same thing which makes it difficult to find. I mean it’s either that or my standards are too high idk.

I got into both these schools as a biochem major but at CSUSB I just got offered a spot for their Presidential Academic Excellence Scholarship (PAES). Before receiving this scholarship however, my parents said they would pay for my four years at UCSB because I got a financial package that they said they would be able to split between the two of them. The real kicker is that I plan to go to med school after my four years and my mother insists that I go to CSUSB because she claims that it would be smart to take the full ride to save up money for med school (which obviously makes sense). I’m just not sure if I want to go to CSUSB. I’d be so glad to hear some of y’all’s suggestions. Thanks for listening :)	UCSB vs full ride at CSUSB Hello everyone so I m really conflicted between these two schools I got into both these schools as a biochem major but at CSUSB I just got offered a spot for their Presidential Academic Excellence Scholarship PAES Before receiving this scholarship however my parents said they would pay for my four years at UCSB because I got a financial package that they said they would be able to split between the two of them The real kicker is that I plan to go to med school after my four years and my mother insists that I go to CSUSB because she claims that it would be smart to take the full ride to save up money for med school which obviously makes sense I m just not sure if I want to go to CSUSB I d be so glad to hear some of y all s suggestions Thanks for listening	3

One person in the double moved out over spring break, so there’s now an open bed.  One of my roommates from the triple asked the girl in the double if she could move in, but the girl refused, saying she wants the whole room to herself for her stuff and for when her boyfriend or friends visit. The girl from the triple even offered a compromise—she’d only use the double when her boyfriend visits since the double girl is often at her boyfriend’s place (double girl’s bf usually visit every month or two depending and around a week each time) and only move her clothes over (leaving the rest in triple), and she will stays in the triple the rest of the time.  Btw to move in to double doesn’t need everyone or the double girl’s approval.   So y’all think it’s fair for the girl in the double to keep the whole room to herself, or should she let the triple roommate move in? Thoughts?

They did it literally every week, even multiple times a week, for the entire quarter.  And I just heard them playing again. A whole quarter had passed, their guitarist still couldn’t get the notes right. I kinda respect them. It takes some balls to present such performance in public.   I also admire whoever writes their songs. Having one song with less than 5 chords is one thing, having everything written with less than 5 chords is legendary.  I wish them all the best tho cause I can feel their vocalist’s passion. Dude always sounds like he’s gonna throw up the next second.

My roommate had a family emergency so he had to suddenly take a gap quarter so I highkey have to find a subleaser to take over his spot.   The address is 65 sabado tarde rd and it’s a 1 bed 1 bath. It would be $800 + utilities a month for a double. You’ll be sharing the double with me but one person is living the living room so it will be 3 people in total. Me and our housemate are pretty chill guys and are easy to get along with.   $800 + utilities is a pretty good price for a double is a pretty good option I think. The lease would be from 4/1-6/16. But lowkey, it’s kinda difficult to find someone willing to fill the spot, maybe because it’s extremely last minute and spring quarter already started today.   If you or anyone you know knows is looking for spring quarter housing please dm me.

I am trying to understand how college physics enriched your learning experience. I love physics and thinking of minoring in physics if possible but, at the same time being mindful of over subscribing and struggling, Hence your feedback will be super helpful.

1	2025-03-31 19:00:30	UCSB VS Cal Poly Slo	For context, I got into Cal Poly SLO as an animal science major and UCSB as a pre-biology major (first-year). Currently, I plan on being a pre-vet student, but I haven’t gotten much experience in the field, and so I worry about whether I’ll change my mind. Right now, though, I can see myself going down the path as a pre-vet student. It's like that feeling where, yeah, I could see myself doing this job, but at the same time, you never know what could change. UCSB is also slightly more expensive than SLO for me.  UCSB: UCSB would be great because I would simply be a biology major, offering a broader range of choices if I choose not to continue as a pre-vet student. Not only that, but it's a UC school–it’s got a good reputation and name. UCSB has many places where I could get pre-vet experiences and a seemingly good pre-vet community. I’ve also visited UCSB, and I love the location overall (especially the beach &amp; its views).  SLO: Slo would be great since I’ll be an animal science major, which means I’ll probably get a lot more hands-on experience with animals overall. This would set me up for applying to vet school and make it easier to meet all my requirements, including courses and experience hours. I also got into the Cal Poly Scholars Program, which means I’d get a scholarship and a free laptop.  Overall, both schools are fantastic. I just worry that if I choose one school over the other, I’ll feel I’ve missed out on something great. Another thing is that many people I know plan on going to SLO, whereas I see no one planning to go to UCSB. Yes, I know I shouldn’t decide based on where everyone else is going, but having someone I already know would be great as I wouldn’t have to dorm with someone I don’t know. Anyways, what would you guys do in my situation? Should I go with UCSB or Cal Poly SLO? I just need some opinions, because I feel super conflicted!

Here is my context:  I am a mechanical engineering major, I like UCSB area slightly more and if I were to commit I would be joining my three friend's lease on a house in Isla Vista.   For SLO I do have friends there already, but only two and I would not be able to live with them.   Now as for academics, I have heard time and time again that CAL SLO is the better route for jobs right off the bat and so on, but people only mention them to be so great for people only getting a bachelors degree. Now, is the graduate program better or worse at UCSB compared to SLO? I have heard that going to grad school helps with jobs and so on, so would it be better to go to SLO and go to grad school there? Or would I be better off getting a graduates at UCSB (if it is more prestigious). (I have always wanted to go to grad school so it is a no brainer)   Another thing to add is that the ""hands on"" learning at SLO was partially taught at my community college, where I used a lot of tools in labs, but I wonder if I wonder learn even more by spending two to three mor years at SLO.

1	2025-03-31 01:16:55	UCSD, UCSB, UCI, or UC davis for pre law?	Hey everybody, I’m a california resident looking for a future in corporate law. I plan on attending one of the t14 law schools, therefore I want to make sure I’m making the best undergraduate decision for my future.   The undergraduate schools I’ve gotten into are UCSD (roosevelt college), UCSB, UC Davis, and UC Irvine. My major is Political Science for all of them.   About me: I’m a very social person and relationships are very important to me. I’ve never enjoyed academics, however i have maintained straight A’s throughout all of high school with a 4.7 weighted GPA by the end. However, I would really like to avoid over exerting myself throughout undergraduate as I want to save as much time as possible that way I can study for the LSAT throughout undergrad. I’m a bare minimum to reach the top kind of guy when it comes to courses/classes.  My concerns: I believe as a person, UCSB would be the college that matches my personality the most. I’m very social and I love the idea of partying and being able to go for morning walks on the beach. I absolutely love the beach like no where else on earth. However, I noticed that UCSB is ranked just out of the top 50 undergraduate schools for political science in the nation, while UCSD is ranked in the top ten and I forget but i think Irvine is top 20.  Ive also heard that Roosevelt college at UCSD requires you to take EXTRA writing classes and the GEs are generally more difficult than the other colleges at UCSD.  So i guess the questions I have: - Which undergraduate will have the most amount of rigor and work, and what will the gap in workload be? And IS IT WORTH IT?  - Which school will I likely get the highest gpa in (because gpa and LSAT are incredibly important to get into the top law schools)? Does going to a less prestigious college mean easier classes??  - Does undergraduate even MATTER that much for law schools (i’m talking t14 law schools tho)? Like would harvard choose a UCSD student over a UCSB student if they had the same stats?    Generally, I want to go to the undergraduate school that will require the least amount of work. I worked my ass off in high school and since law school is going to be soul sucking, I want to enjoy these next four years of my life. However, i’m not willing to sacrifice my potential future for some relaxation. If going to UCSD over UCSB is that big of a difference, I guess i’ll go to UC socially dead.    So yeah, if there’s any UCSB or UCSD and possibly Irvine pre-law students who have advice, please I’ll take anything!	UCSD UCSB UCI or UC davis for pre law Hey everybody I m a california resident looking for a future in corporate law I plan on attending one of the t14 law schools therefore I want to make sure I m making the best undergraduate decision for my future The undergraduate schools I ve gotten into are UCSD roosevelt college UCSB UC Davis and UC Irvine My major is Political Science for all of them About me I m a very social person and relationships are very important to me I ve never enjoyed academics however i have maintained straight A s throughout all of high school with a 4 7 weighted GPA by the end However I would really like to avoid over exerting myself throughout undergraduate as I want to save as much time as possible that way I can study for the LSAT throughout undergrad I m a bare minimum to reach the top kind of guy when it comes to courses classes My concerns I believe as a person UCSB would be the college that matches my personality the most I m very social and I love the idea of partying and being able to go for morning walks on the beach I absolutely love the beach like no where else on earth However I noticed that UCSB is ranked just out of the top 50 undergraduate schools for political science in the nation while UCSD is ranked in the top ten and I forget but i think Irvine is top 20 Ive also heard that Roosevelt college at UCSD requires you to take EXTRA writing classes and the GEs are generally more difficult than the other colleges at UCSD So i guess the questions I have Which undergraduate will have the most amount of rigor and work and what will the gap in workload be And IS IT WORTH IT Which school will I likely get the highest gpa in because gpa and LSAT are incredibly important to get into the top law schools Does going to a less prestigious college mean easier classes Does undergraduate even MATTER that much for law schools i m talking t14 law schools tho Like would harvard choose a UCSD student over a UCSB student if they had the same stats Generally I want to go to the undergraduate school that will require the least amount of work I worked my ass off in high school and since law school is going to be soul sucking I want to enjoy these next four years of my life However i m not willing to sacrifice my potential future for some relaxation If going to UCSD over UCSB is that big of a difference I guess i ll go to UC socially dead So yeah if there s any UCSB or UCSD and possibly Irvine pre law students who have advice please I ll take anything	3

The first two years of es is literally just prereqs and I have yet to use any of class material from bio, chem or physics in my upper div es courses. And also since i took those courses a while ago, I barely remember the content. It just feels like the first two years were a waste, especially since I’ve taken chem, bio, calc and physics in high school and some of it just felt like a repeat of that at ucsb.  I also feel concerned about my path after I graduate. I have no idea what I want to do or what I can do with an es degree. I feel like my mentality coming into es was I will figure out what I’m interested in once I start taking upper div courses. But honestly I haven’t taken a course where I felt extremely passionate even if I did enjoy them.   Now that I’m almost a senior, I feel like I’m kind of behind. My gpa is 3.55 so idk if that’s high enough for grad school. At this point, I feel like I just want to start focusing on one area in this field just so I can have some kind of focus at all and worry about finding what I’m truly passionate about at a later time. I’ve been encouraged to do research so I’m thinking about talking to TAs or profs to see if they have any opportunities available. I don’t know if that’s something worth doing. I also realized I should start doing more than just volunteering so I can add them to the resume. I don’t know how to get an internship at the moment though since my resume is just volunteering and a club board position. Other people in es, how did you pass interviews and secure an internship?

I just got admitted to UCSB (super excited!), but I’m wondering if it’s possible to switch my **primary and alternate majors** now that I’m in. I originally applied with **Psychology** as my first choice and **Biopsychology** as my backup, but I’m realizing I’d rather have my alternate as my main major.

Though there is no dedicated business school or finance major at UCSB, it appears that a lot of people choose to major in Econ or Econ/Accounting instead and Econ is the second most popular major there. I’m also aware that a Finance club exists. I was wondering if lots of people end up working in financial related careers, or what most students typically do with their Econ degree from UCSB. Is there good Finance recruiting/internships, or are the opportunities lackluster? I’m aware it’s not a target school, but it’s one of the best choices I have available to me.

Also, is switching majors within the school of  engineering possible.

I was admitted to both UCLA (pre-mathematics for teaching) and UCSB (pre-mathematics for colleges of Letters and Science) as freshman and a promise scholar, and I am conflicted between both of these schools. As of now I am looking into becoming a high school math teacher, but that can change. My aid for both schools match the cost of attendance, where I am being offered about 34k in grants and scholarships for UCLA where where about 10k is offered to me in workstudy and loans; and at ucsb I am being offer about 37k in grants scholarships where about 9k is being offered to me in work study and loans. That leaves me at a total aid of  about 43.5k for ucla, and about 47k total aid for ucsb. I know UCLA is very prestigious, a beautiful campus, AMAZING food, and an excellent graduate program for math. I am not the biggest fan of the LA environment. UCSB has another beautiful campus, i liek the environment of Santa Barbara than I do LA, Im being offered More money financially, its an hour further home from me when compared to UCLA.

Does this only apply to CCS math classes or does it also apply to other classes, such as those in college of engineering or letters and science.  3.

Cal Poly: Pros - smaller class sizes, easier to get to know professors and letters of rec, taught by profs instead of a TA, not competing with grad students as much (would this make it easier to get research compared to a UC?), cool place, more hands on experience Cons - not as well known as UC schools outside of California, would change from quarter to semester system after my freshman year (would this impact labs or classes negatively?), clinical experience may be difficult to get  UC Davis: Pros - well regarded, really good biochem program, easier to get clinical experience Cons - close to home (this makes it seem kinda boring/depressing to me), a lot of classes taught by TAs, large class sizes, not as much clinical experience I am unsure how easy it is to get research and internship opportunities here given that there are so many premeds here.  I do not know much about UCSB so any input on being a premed/biochem major here and how the school compares to the other two would be appreciated.    Also, how is the grade deflation/inflation at each school?

Last week I received an email that added something like “the funding contract cannot be guaranteed due to federal funding uncertainties”. I asked the department to clarify and they said my funding package hasn’t changed it’s just some “precautionary measure”.

I’ve also retaken 16 units and at this point I can’t retake with a better grade for a class. I’m now at a point where this class, which I have an F for and now a D+ on my major GPA have tanked my major GPA and I will be forced to switch majors as I cannot meet the requirement. I’m in my fourth year, and will be taking an extra year but all of my GE’s are done and I don’t have anything but major classes to take and I really cannot afford to take more than 5 years. I’m thinking of switching, once again, and my best option may be economics. The only problem is that they’ve got only Econ 1, 2, 10A and I have a C+ and C. Even if I get an A in econ10A, I would still be at a 2.75 and the major requires a 2.85. What do I do? Do I drop out? Do I switch to something where I have to start over completely? I have so many math classes on my transcript and doing something unrelated feels completely wasteful. I’m more than willing to take summer classes and if I map out correctly, I can take 12 units each quarter after taking four sessions for upper divs in econ this summer but regardless, if I can’t even get accepted to “full major” what’s the point? I feel a bit useless and like I’ve wasted a part of my life due to having academic difficulties intertwined with my hardship situations.   I don’t know what to do. Anything at all really would be helpful. I know I need to speak to an advisor, but who do I go to?

UCSB would be in state for me, but after scholarships, the cost will be the same.  Tempe is probably easier to get to (2 hour flight vs 6 hour car ride), but that’s not a huge deal.  I am looking at future job prospects. Construction is a strong field with high salary and 100% job placement rate. I am a hands-on person who loves architecture/design and leadership. The big city offers internships and jobs. I will be in the Barrett Honors College.  Very hot though.  UCSB offers the best environment and I love going hiking, the ocean. I would enjoy anything related to studying the environment and research. Problem is that I think finding a job in the major will be harder, and pay probably way less. No honors college.   I would love perspectives, as I love both majors. Right now I am leaning going to Arizona, but obviously UCSB is a higher level school.

Back when I was a high school senior applying to college, EVERYONE told me not to go to a UC if I’m pre-med. The main reason for this was due to the fact that they’re public schools with low funding, and as a result, competition is high, the quality of advising is low, and class sizes are huge. This made me extremely nervous since I am a California resident and had always seen myself attending a UC, but I had wanted to be a doctor for the greater part of my life. I know I probably wasn’t the only one feeling this way, so if you are feeling discouraged about being pre-med at a large public school, or if you’re on the fence about which UC you should attend as a pre-med, this is for you.  Note: I do not have experience with private universities, so if those are the options you have available to you, I’ll trust you to do the research on what’s best for you yourself.  Disclaimer: This is coming from a current 3rd year who plans on applying this upcoming cycle in a few months, so take what you will from that.  Here's the link to the document detailing all of the wonderful things UCSB has to offer potential pre-meds, and please feel free to dm me with any questions you might have: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LK11VRmTaA6CqhiLJQSFK7GjuDf9kYqVxkMuIjk8rRc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LK11VRmTaA6CqhiLJQSFK7GjuDf9kYqVxkMuIjk8rRc/edit?usp=sharing)	UCSB A Hidden Gem for Pre Meds I posted this last year but with decisions out I ve decided to bring it back for prospective pre meds who have been accepted to UCSB this year Back when I was a high school senior applying to college EVERYONE told me not to go to a UC if I m pre med The main reason for this was due to the fact that they re public schools with low funding and as a result competition is high the quality of advising is low and class sizes are huge This made me extremely nervous since I am a California resident and had always seen myself attending a UC but I had wanted to be a doctor for the greater part of my life I know I probably wasn t the only one feeling this way so if you are feeling discouraged about being pre med at a large public school or if you re on the fence about which UC you should attend as a pre med this is for you Note I do not have experience with private universities so if those are the options you have available to you I ll trust you to do the research on what s best for you yourself Disclaimer This is coming from a current 3rd year who plans on applying this upcoming cycle in a few months so take what you will from that Here s the link to the document detailing all of the wonderful things UCSB has to offer potential pre meds and please feel free to dm me with any questions you might have	3

It’s frustrating because the pre-comm GPA requirement to move forward is very specific, and now I’m worried I won’t meet it. Here’s a quick rundown:  • COMM 1: B-  • COMM 87: A  • COMM 88: C+ (.29 away from B-)  I’ve emailed my professor, but no luck with changing the grade. I’ve also reached out to advising, but haven’t received any helpful advice on how to make up for this. My final class to complete the sequence is COMM 89, but I need to figure out how to recover from this C+ to meet the GPA requirement.  Has anyone been in a similar situation? What steps can I take to either raise my GPA or improve my standing before it’s too late? I’m trying not to spiral here, but I’m feeling pretty stuck.  Any tips or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

However, I’ve seen so many people talk positively about the CCS experience for physics, and I’m really bummed out I didn’t bother applying for the CCS physics. The extra professor connections, increases resources, and unparalleled grad school preparation really aligns with my career plans.   Therefore, I have a few questions…  1) How feasible would it be to switch from L&amp;S Physics to CCS physics? I know it would likely be competitive, but would it be realistically feasible in the first place (as someone who hasn’t taken AP Physics C in HS, as it wasn’t offered)?  2) Does taking L&amp;S Physics still set me up for top-tier grad programs if I perform well?  3) Speaking of doing well, how much more difficult would it be to find research opportunities? I know I will be competing with CSS students, but I also won’t be competing with many grad students.   4) Simply put, even though CCS Physics is better, is L&amp;S Physics still an amazing physics program that sets me up well for grad school?

Japanese girls are the only ones to fill up tier 1. However, the South Korean people are so closely genetically related to the Yamato (mainland) Japanese people that the Korean girls would not fit in tier 2. Rather, South Korean girls go into ""honorary tier 1"", and, for all intents and purposes, they are equal to the Japs but (just very slightly) distinct, genetically speaking, from them. Note that, by now, South Korea has a higher HDI ranking than Japan, and The Republic of Korea has long been more innovative than Japan as well.    In tier 2 go the Okinawan girls. This is because, despite being Japanese by nationality, the Ryukyuan (Okinawan) people are genetically more distinct from the Japs than the Korean people are.

I got accepted into both UC Davis and UCSB, I’m leaning towards SB because it’s a little more local (I’m from LA) and has a beautiful location. I plan to double major in Poly Sci and English, which I read UC Davis has better programs for. I know that Davis would be good for its proximity to Sacramento in case I want to get into law/politics, but I fear that I have this idea that Davis is “in the middle of no where”. I feel like the party culture of SB is a little intimidating, not something that I’m totally opposed to but just a bit out of my realm. What do you guys think?

1	2025-03-24 17:36:52	Is it possible to pay only once per quarter?	I've been getting annoyed with how the payment system works. The problem is that I get charged the tuition every quarter then later I can add a meal plan then even later i get charged for healthcare.  Each time I make a payment, there's a fee, so I'd like to only pay once per quarter if possible. If I pay the full amount (tuition + healthcare + meal plan) when the tuition first posts, it takes so long for the healthcare to post and for the meal plan to be available that I get a refund for the healthcare and meal plan costs. However, if I wait to pay until i the meal plan is available, then it's too late. The deadline for paying tuition has passed and now I'm not registered for the quarter, and so I cannot order a meal plan. If I pay the tuition at this point then I'll still be in classes as long as I don't wait too long, but there doesn't seem to be a great solution.  Anyone have this same problem?

Whereas I meet an Econ and accounting major with a big 4 offer every other day. My dilemma is that I’m a transfer junior, and I can graduate in time if I switch over to Econ and acct but it will be incredibly tight and challenging. Like I may need to take 140 and 101 over the summer together 😭.   Is it worth the switch? Am i just speaking to the wrong Econ majors?   Thanks for reading guys!

I’ve narrowed it down to either SDSU (business administration in marketing) or UCSB (communications); both of which I have already been accepted to and I have visited both campuses briefly.  I’m looking for a college with a good social life and fun events to do regularly while also attending someplace where I can get internships/opportunities. I want to do something in the marketing industry, but there’s also a part of me who wants to do law school after (I might request a major change for UCSB to switch to Political Science). A nice campus, diversity, and clean dorms are things I prioritize.  Honestly, I think I would be happy with either school, but I just wanted some advice to help choose. Thoughts?

1	2025-03-23 04:48:16	Harvard or UCSB	I’ve found myself in a bit of a predicament and could use some outside perspective. I’ve been fortunate enough to be accepted to Harvard for quantum physics. It’s a solid offer—Rhodes Scholar with distinction, a full-ride scholarship, potential lab positions lined up with several professors in their quantum foundry, and it’s just five minutes from where I live. My girlfriend is also attending Harvard, so the logistics would be pretty seamless.  That said, I also got into UCSB for physics, which, as many of you know, has a lot going for it. The campus is literally on the beach. Like, you can walk out of class and be on the sand within minutes. The ocean breeze, the relaxed atmosphere—it’s a vibe that you just don’t get in Cambridge. There’s a strong case to be made for work-life balance, and UCSB has that in spades.  I’ve been trying to weigh the pros and cons:   **Harvard Pros:**  * One of the top quantum physics programs in the world * Rhodes Scholar distinction opens a lot of doors * Full-ride scholarship * Already in touch with professors in the quantum foundry for research positions * Five-minute commute * My girlfriend is attending  **UCSB Pros:**  * Beach  I'm really struggling with this decision and could use some help from physics students currently attending UCSB. Both schools have a lot to offer, and I’m just trying to figure out what makes the most sense for my future. Thanks.

1	2025-03-23 04:16:35	UCSB or UCLA or Cal Poly SLO??	(Mathematics major) I feel like this should be a no brainer, but I am having trouble deciding between these three schools. So for a bit context, this past Friday i recently received my final college application from UCLA, and i ended up getting accepted with a 10k scholarship granted. I also ended up receiving a 30k scholarship from UCD and UCSD. Now, I have been very conflicted between these 3 schools as admissions came out, but I’d probably have Cal Poly SLO and UCLA around the level for myself, and then ucsb a level below. For both Cal Poly and UCLA I’d be paying around 10k a year, based on the total cost minus grants and scholarships, I understand that the price can be lower. However, the same day I was admitted to UCSB, my financial aid offer for that UCSB was released and I saw that I was admitted to the promise scholars program, which would provide 120k in scholarships and grant, practically guaranteeing me a full ride and allow me to do much more such as study abroad and cover the cost of graduate school. I understand that this is an insane luxury, and my brain is telling me this is the route to take, but my heart is telling me to be a bruin or mustang. What I love about those schools in the environment and their great academics. I need the people of Reddit input.

I wouldn't be able to get a parking permit first year there and I need to bring my car 2. housing crisis ? is the mold taken care of ? 3. UCSB requires the most graduation credits out of all the schools I applied for (180-184) so I'd need 140 credits to graduate meaning I'd be there a bit longer than I anticipated. Transfer is also an option if I need to stay home and finish up fall semester there and transfer I'm willing if it's worth it.  Do I commit? Do I wait ? Do I try to transfer to Pepp later ?

I tried resetting my password a number of times and nothing fixed the issue. The main problem I can think of is that when I signed up for the portal, I entered both my perm number and my application ID when you're only supposed to enter one of the two, so I tried signing up again using only entering one of them to no avail.     I contacted the UCSB admissions office and they said to check my general application portal for all UCs to see my security questions but I can't find them anywhere in there. I then contacted support for the general portal and they said that just happens sometimes and to contact UCSB admissions (lol)     I did get an email congratulating me on being accepted but I want to get into the portal to know for sure. Has anyone else had this issue or have any ideas on how to fix it? I would contact the UCSB admissions office again but I believe they're closed at the moment and I'm eager to see my decision.

Dear UCSB administrators,  Last night we received six emergency alerts over the span of over 4 hours. Like myself, some of us had an 8am final and were kept up by the circling helicopter and directions to await further instructions.  The first alert was sent at 10:38pm about a crime and the second alert specifying a shooting was sent at 11:22pm. However, the 911 call reporting the shooting is time stamped at 10:34pm, over an before we are actually notified. Moreover, the alert only stated a shooting and armed robbery occurred, making it unclear if there was currently an active shooter threat. Per UCSB’s Emergency Management Protocals, this distinction is necessary. Most problematic is the question of why it took so long to notify students of a shooting. If there’s a shooting at 10:34pm with a suspect, not notifying students of this threat until an hour after is deeply troubling — it’s like telling students to evacuate a building due to a chemical leak an hour after it started. In other words, some alerts offer no practical use. In addition, haphazardly sending students emergency notifications, especially alerts that direct us to undertake actions that will affect the following day (like an 8am final), undermines situations when the emergency is actually present and dangerous. If students come to see these alters as arbitrary and distracting, then in real emergencies the alert system is less affective.   Perhaps the most ironic part is that it was actually the SBCO FD that was first to warn student of a shooting and that an individual actually had been shot (while they may have more immediate access to this information due to medical care, it’s still not an excuse for UCSB to after the fact send an alert that doesn’t even specify if an individual had been shot, information they presumably had (remember, the 911 call for the shooting goes out at 10:30pm). Having trust in our school officials in being able to provide timely and appropriate details about emergencies is crucial. Last night, they dropped the ball and had students awake for hours wondering if there was a shooter and if  someone had been shot. Clearly, describing the incident as “a shooting” and then directing everyone to shelter in place until further instruction was irresponsible at best. Obviously most of us didn’t necessarily lock our doors per se and wait in fear as the updates were given, but what if the situation was actually life-threatening? Can UCSB ensure that this can be conveyed clearly to students via this system? Last night casts strong doubt on that ability. I request that our officials immediately schedule a review of all protocols and organisational matters related to the emergency notification system.  Sincerely,   A student that got 3hrs of sleep	Last Nights Shooting Raises Questions About the Effectiveness of our Emergency Notification System Dear UCSB administrators Last night we received six emergency alerts over the span of over 4 hours Like myself some of us had an 8am final and were kept up by the circling helicopter and directions to await further instructions The first alert was sent at 10 38pm about a crime and the second alert specifying a shooting was sent at 11 22pm However the 911 call reporting the shooting is time stamped at 10 34pm over an before we are actually notified Moreover the alert only stated a shooting and armed robbery occurred making it unclear if there was currently an active shooter threat Per UCSB s Emergency Management Protocals this distinction is necessary Most problematic is the question of why it took so long to notify students of a shooting If there s a shooting at 10 34pm with a suspect not notifying students of this threat until an hour after is deeply troubling it s like telling students to evacuate a building due to a chemical leak an hour after it started In other words some alerts offer no practical use In addition haphazardly sending students emergency notifications especially alerts that direct us to undertake actions that will affect the following day like an 8am final undermines situations when the emergency is actually present and dangerous If students come to see these alters as arbitrary and distracting then in real emergencies the alert system is less affective Perhaps the most ironic part is that it was actually the SBCO FD that was first to warn student of a shooting and that an individual actually had been shot while they may have more immediate access to this information due to medical care it s still not an excuse for UCSB to after the fact send an alert that doesn t even specify if an individual had been shot information they presumably had remember the 911 call for the shooting goes out at 10 30pm Having trust in our school officials in being able to provide timely and appropriate details about emergencies is crucial Last night they dropped the ball and had students awake for hours wondering if there was a shooter and if someone had been shot Clearly describing the incident as a shooting and then directing everyone to shelter in place until further instruction was irresponsible at best Obviously most of us didn t necessarily lock our doors per se and wait in fear as the updates were given but what if the situation was actually life threatening Can UCSB ensure that this can be conveyed clearly to students via this system Last night casts strong doubt on that ability I request that our officials immediately schedule a review of all protocols and organisational matters related to the emergency notification system Sincerely A student that got 3hrs of sleep	27
1	2025-03-20 19:44:12	Last Nights Shooting Raises Serious Questions of the Effectiveness of our Emergency Notification System	Dear UCSB Administration,  Last night, we received six emergency alerts over the span of more than four hours. Like many others, I had an 8 am final and was kept up by the circling helicopter and the instructions to await further guidance.  The first alert was sent at 10:38 pm about a crime, and the second, specifying a shooting, was sent at 11:22 pm. However, the 911 call reporting the shooting is timestamped at 10:34 pm, almost an hour before we were actually notified. Moreover, the alert only mentioned a shooting and an armed robbery, without clarifying whether there was an active shooter threat. According to UCSB’s Emergency Management Protocols, this distinction is necessary. The delay in notifying students of a shooting is deeply troubling. If there’s a shooting at 10:34 pm with a suspect, failing to notify students about this threat until an hour later is unacceptable—it’s like waiting an hour to notify students of a chemical leak in a building. In other words, some alerts are not useful in real-time emergencies.  Additionally, sending emergency notifications haphazardly, especially when those alerts direct us to take actions that affect important events like finals (e.g., an 8 am exam), undermines the effectiveness of the system in future emergencies. If students start to perceive these alerts as arbitrary or distracting, the system will be less effective in situations that truly pose danger.  Perhaps the most ironic part is that the SBCO FD was the first to warn students about the shooting, confirming that an individual had been shot. While they may have more immediate access to this information due to their involvement in medical care, it is still inexcusable for UCSB to send an alert that did not even specify that someone had been shot, especially when they likely had that information (since the 911 call came in at 10:30 pm).  Trusting our school officials to provide timely, clear details during emergencies is crucial. Unfortunately, last night, the system failed to do so. Students were left awake for hours, uncertain if there was an active shooter and whether someone had been shot. Describing the incident merely as “a shooting” and instructing everyone to shelter in place until further instruction was irresponsible, at best. While most students didn’t necessarily lock their doors or remain in fear, what if the situation had actually been life-threatening?  Can UCSB ensure that emergency situations can be clearly conveyed to students through this system in the future? Last night has cast doubt on that ability. I respectfully request that our officials immediately schedule a review of all protocols and organizational matters related to the emergency notification system.  Sincerely, A student who got 3 hours of sleep.

I know that UCD is amazing for terrestrial biology, but when I visited UCSB I fell in love with the location and atmosphere-  if I could get the UCD major at UCSB it would be the perfect college for me. I have been doing a lot of research into the EEMB/Zoology majors online but it's been hard to get a good picture of what it's like.   First of all, how are the terrestrial classes? I'm very aware that UCSB is more marine centered, which is great, but I'd also like to take classes in terrestrial conservation.  Secondly, how difficult is it to find terrestrial internships/volunteer opportunities? What were they like?  Finally, how conservation bio focused are the EEMB/zoology courses? That's my final career goal and I'd love to take classes that align with it!  Thank you!

(I would major in global affairs at UCSB and then pursue an MBA)  (thinking of double-majoring in business &amp; international studies then MBA at CU boulder)  I also got one scholarship for CU Boulder, (and hopefully soon more lol) but tuition is not a factor for me, I'm OOS for both.  I'm leaning towards Boulder because the business programs are great (UCSB doesn't have a business major or school), overall it's a strong school. I also love snowboarding, hiking, yoga, all the outdoorsy stuff of Boulder!!   My parents are really leaning towards UCSB due to the UC prestige, and family (not immediate family but yknow) is in california. (also got into UCSD, UCD, and full OOS tuition scholarship to UCSC. In terms of costs, I would be paying \~40K at CU Boulder and \~90K/year at UCSB. The housing situation and transportation situations in UCSB are pushing me away, but I also hear so many amazing things about UCSB!     please let me know what one you guys would choose, pros &amp; cons of both, any advice.

The official UCSB website places the total cost (including direct and indirect costs) at a whopping 70k. Although when I look up the average cost to attend UCSB out of state, I’m seeing a number in the 47k range. Is this accurate? Did you get any merit aid, financial aid?  I really want to attend UCSB, but 70k is too much. Any thoughts?

However, I am a little worried about its title as “The #1 Party School in the Nation.”   I am a very quiet and introverted person and I am terrified at the prospect of not being able to make friends because everyone will be more outgoing and into partying than I am. Additionally, I’ll be Pre-Medicine so I’m not sure if I’ll have much time to party even if I wanted to.   I’ve seen a few people mention a quiet life is possible at UCSB, but I’m just wondering if there’s any truth to this? If it is true—what does that exactly look like?

I'm trying to decide between UC Santa Barbara and San Diego State University for a future career in social science teaching. I’d love to hear from current students or alumni from either school to get some insight on the pros and cons.  If you've attended either UCSB or SDSU (or know someone who has), I’d really appreciate any advice or personal experiences you can share. Which school do you think would prepare me better for a career in teaching social science? Also how's life in each school, the food, the parties, I am not a Greek life fellow or party guy. How are the dorms and facilities. Also, if I go into social science to teach, SDSU has a neat 4 year program to go straight into teaching and its general social science, whereas with UCSB I would have to pick a specific major, like psych or history, should this be a deciding factor or does it not matter as much.

I know their website says not to send a letter of continued interest (LOCI) or any additional messages, but here’s where I’m stuck:  About a year ago, I met my admissions counselor during a tour, and we stayed in contact. I emailed her a lot with questions, made sure to meet with her when she visited my state, and even got her to review my essays and application. She really got to know my story and even told me that my attributes were strong, but not all of them fully came through in my original app. With her advice, I edited my application accordingly, making sure to implement all her recommendations.  After she read my final app, we stayed in touch, and she even told me she hoped this wouldn’t be the end of our story. Now that I’m waitlisted, I feel totally lost. Should I email her just to say thank you for even waitlisting me? Or do I stay silent like the UCSB website says?  A few weeks ago, I actually emailed her just to check in and tell her I was excited for the upcoming admissions updates, but she never replied. Now I’m wondering—am I overthinking this? Were we even that close, or was I just delusional? I don’t want to come off as annoying, but I also don’t want to miss an opportunity to stay on her radar.  Any advice?

1	2025-03-19 07:11:11	Stuck Between Cal Poly SLO &amp; UCSB—Need Advice!	Hey everyone, I’m currently torn between **Cal Poly SLO and UCSB**, and I’d love to hear some insight from people familiar with these schools.  Last year, I had the chance to visit **both campuses**, and while I **fell in love** with UCSB, I also **really liked** Cal Poly SLO. UCSB definitely felt **more like my vibe**, but there are a few factors making my decision complicated.  # Where I Stand Right Now:  * I was **waitlisted at UCSB**, but I have **good communication with an admissions officer** and feel confident that I have a strong chance of getting off the waitlist. * I’m already **accepted at Cal Poly SLO** (for Political Science), so I need to think practically about my future plans.  # Academic Considerations:  * **Ideally, I’d like to study business** because my long-term goal is to become a **corporate lawyer** while also having the flexibility to **run my own business** if I choose. * **UCSB only offers Economics**, not Business. While I know Econ can still be a strong path toward law school or entrepreneurship, I’m unsure if it will give me the same practical foundation as a Business program. * **At Cal Poly, I applied for Political Science** to improve my chances of admission. I know I can switch to Business after a year, and since I have **many business-related prerequisites through Running Start**, this wouldn’t set me back too much. That said, I also know that **switching from Political Science to Business at Cal Poly can be difficult**, so it’s not a guarantee.  # Cultural &amp; Social Fit:  * I’m **Persian**, and while I have no issue being in a predominantly white environment, I do think the **greater diversity at UCSB** would be a nice aspect of my college experience. * I also feel that UCSB's overall **social and campus vibe** aligns with me more than Cal Poly’s.  # Career Prospects &amp; Reputation:  * I’ve heard that **Cal Poly has better post-grad employment statistics**, particularly in business-related fields. * At the same time, **UCSB is nationally known and ranked highly**, and I loved everything about it when I visited.  At the end of the day, **UCSB felt like my calling**—when I was on campus, it just felt like I needed to be there. But at the same time, I could also **see myself at Cal Poly**, and I know that I need to be practical about my future and what will set me up for success. I don’t want to choose a school just based on a gut feeling if it could potentially make things harder for me down the road.  # Main Concerns:  * If I go to **Cal Poly and I'm unable to switch from Political Science to Business**, and I later decide **I don’t want to continue in law, what do I do?** What career options would I have? * If I go to **UCSB, does having an Econ degree instead of a Business degree make my degree less valuable?** * Overall, is a **Cal Poly degree better than a UCSB degree nowadays in terms of job opportunities and career success?**  Would love to hear any perspectives, especially from people who have attended or know a lot about these schools! **Lmk what you think**	Stuck Between Cal Poly SLO amp UCSB Need Advice Hey everyone I m currently torn between Cal Poly SLO and UCSB and I d love to hear some insight from people familiar with these schools Last year I had the chance to visit both campuses and while I fell in love with UCSB I also really liked Cal Poly SLO UCSB definitely felt more like my vibe but there are a few factors making my decision complicated Where I Stand Right Now I was waitlisted at UCSB but I have good communication with an admissions officer and feel confident that I have a strong chance of getting off the waitlist I m already accepted at Cal Poly SLO for Political Science so I need to think practically about my future plans Academic Considerations Ideally I d like to study business because my long term goal is to become a corporate lawyer while also having the flexibility to run my own business if I choose UCSB only offers Economics not Business While I know Econ can still be a strong path toward law school or entrepreneurship I m unsure if it will give me the same practical foundation as a Business program At Cal Poly I applied for Political Science to improve my chances of admission I know I can switch to Business after a year and since I have many business related prerequisites through Running Start this wouldn t set me back too much That said I also know that switching from Political Science to Business at Cal Poly can be difficult so it s not a guarantee Cultural amp Social Fit I m Persian and while I have no issue being in a predominantly white environment I do think the greater diversity at UCSB would be a nice aspect of my college experience I also feel that UCSB s overall social and campus vibe aligns with me more than Cal Poly s Career Prospects amp Reputation I ve heard that Cal Poly has better post grad employment statistics particularly in business related fields At the same time UCSB is nationally known and ranked highly and I loved everything about it when I visited At the end of the day UCSB felt like my calling when I was on campus it just felt like I needed to be there But at the same time I could also see myself at Cal Poly and I know that I need to be practical about my future and what will set me up for success I don t want to choose a school just based on a gut feeling if it could potentially make things harder for me down the road Main Concerns If I go to Cal Poly and I m unable to switch from Political Science to Business and I later decide I don t want to continue in law what do I do What career options would I have If I go to UCSB does having an Econ degree instead of a Business degree make my degree less valuable Overall is a Cal Poly degree better than a UCSB degree nowadays in terms of job opportunities and career success Would love to hear any perspectives especially from people who have attended or know a lot about these schools Lmk what you think	3

I am also assuming I will probably be allowed to enter the honors program which would make for good connections with professors.   how would this compare to a normal program in applied math at ucla?   not sure if this would change anything, but I would essentially be starting my study in upper division as I have taken the lower division courses at local community colleges.	ucsb regents vs ucla in applied math hi ive been admitted to ucsb as a regents scholar and was wondering how that might stack up to ucla in applied math since im a regents scholar for ucsb I would get 5k a year as well as priority housing I am also assuming I will probably be allowed to enter the honors program which would make for good connections with professors how would this compare to a normal program in applied math at ucla not sure if this would change anything but I would essentially be starting my study in upper division as I have taken the lower division courses at local community colleges	3

For context, I was admitted to SDSU in December as a Computer Science major, and UCSB today as my alternate major which is Statistics and Data Science. It’s a bit difficult to decide which I should choose if my end goal is ultimately to become a data scientist. There are many pros and cons to both colleges for example: SDSU is in a better location for employment/internships, but I’ve also heard their Computer Science major isn’t very strong. UCSB is a more well-funded school and likely has better classes, however the Statistics and Data Science major also has mixed reviews that I’ve seen online. Another thing about UCSB that I was curious about is if it’s even worth trying to attend and try to transfer to computer science my first year, I know it’s very unlikely. Anyways if anyone has any advice on making a decision, I’d appreciate it.

However, my major is different for both campuses.   I got admitted as a cognitive science major for UC Davis and I got admitted as a pre-psychological and sciences major for UC Santa Barbara.

Commuting for the second year is a consideration down the future in UCD. However, i’d have to work part time to be able to afford rent at UCSB. But both are completely different environments.   Personally, from your opinions… what do you guys consider worth it based on your time at the campus you’re at (including academics and social life)  Do you have any regrets? How is the housing situation, is it hard to find places to live for the 2nd year to the 4th?

I was just wondering what the best course of action would be if I attend UCSB in the fall (if anyone has insight), I'm willing to work hard throughout the year to get where I want to be, I'm just not sure if it would be better to try and transfer to another school like SLO for engineering or to attempt to get into chemical engineering later down the road and what that would look like.

I was lucky enough to get in to the CCS Physics program at UCSB from out of state, but I’m interested in astrophysics specifically. I’m wondering how good/competitive those opportunities are at UCSB, as there isn’t a specific astrophysics major like other schools. Is UCSB’s astrophysics as good as their physics in general, which I know is excellent for research opportunities especially in CCS?  Also side note, I’ve been kind of concerned about a potential lack of opportunities due to the federal funding cuts. I know UCLA was affected a lot by it, but I’m hoping it won’t have too much of an impact.  Thanks in advance for your advice!

I know for many people, this is the school they dream of studying by the beach at, and riding their bikes to class, or spending Deltopia partying with your 20 closest friends that you met in your dorm. But at the end of the day, it is one public research university in a sea of others just like it. This one just happens to be by the beach.   It is a great school, but there are a lot of great schools. It's not any easier to make friends here, or find a job after graduating, or find a place to live off campus, or least of all get into classes, than anywhere else.   I know college admissions season can be emotionally exhausting, but I hope you'll keep in mind that your world is going to get bigger in the most beautiful ways when you graduate or transfer or leave wherever you are now, no matter where you end up. It won't be easy, not by a long shot, but it will be incredible.

1	2025-03-16 22:17:16	Please help me decide between Pitt, UCSB, and UCSD	Asking subreddits of all 3 colleges:  Background: current senior from California, planning on majoring in biology and philosophy before getting an MD/PhD after college. Hoping to do something brain-related involving both clinical and research work (neurology or psychiatry most likely). I've been accepted to several schools so far and have narrowed down my choices to Pitt, UC Santa Barbara, and UC San Diego so far (waiting on ivy day haha).     Other information: I would like to get involved in research ASAP, ideally in freshman year. I'm planning on emailing professors early April after all my decisions come back, though I may push the date back depending on how the political climate changes. I have a fair bit of research experience already in microbiology/plant molecular biology (\~1000 hours), but I'm looking to get into more neuro-related lab work in college (specifically concerning brain tumors or psychiatry).      Anyways, here are what I think of the 3 schools. I would really appreciate any insights from current students regarding UCSB specifically, such as my majors, opportunities, things to watch out for, etc. Thanks a lot, and sorry for the long post!  **Pitt:**   Molecular Biology + Philosophy  * Pros:    * Honors College (priority registration, advising, BPhil degree option sounds really interesting)    * Great for premed and biology, has med school for clinical activities    * I’ll probably get to live in my own apartment (cheap cost of living, no on-campus living requirement)    * Top ranked philosophy department    * Big hub for neuroscience research    * Lots of things to do in Pittsburgh - museums, restaurants, etc.    * On the east coast (I lived in New York during middle school and really want to go back) * Cons:    * Going through significant financial trouble (NIH cuts, hiring freezes, etc) - very big red flag for me.    * Somewhat less prestige/lower ranking (not a major factor)  **UCSB:**  Molecular and Cell Biology + Philosophy  * Pros:    * Regents scholarship perks (guaranteed 4-years housing w/ first choice dorm rooms, specialized advising)    * Less competition for premed? It's not a very popular destination for premeds from what I can find.    * I vibe with the campus. Also really great weather.    * I can see myself transferring into the Creative Studies college for biology very early if I commit. Basically a tiny liberal arts college with heavy focus on research from what I've gathered? * Cons:    * Party culture, not really my thing    * In California... I would be stuck here for 4 more years at least.    * Not that well known for biology, no med school. Though I am aware of some clinical opportunities!    * Does not have many researchers in my area of interest  **UCSD:**  Molecular and Cell Biology + Philosophy  * Pros:    * One of the best schools for biology, has a med school for clinical opportunities    * Lots of researchers in neuroscience    * Academic/nerdy culture    * Overall prestige is highest, possibly more opened doors?    * Lots of opportunities for bio in SD * Cons:    * Only 2 years of guaranteed housing, SD housing market seems brutal    * Lots of premed competition    * In California    * Significantly more expensive option compared to Pitt &amp; UCSB, but still affordable (42k/year vs \~10k/year for Pitt &amp; UCSB)	Please help me decide between Pitt UCSB and UCSD Asking subreddits of all 3 colleges Background current senior from California planning on majoring in biology and philosophy before getting an MD PhD after college Hoping to do something brain related involving both clinical and research work neurology or psychiatry most likely I ve been accepted to several schools so far and have narrowed down my choices to Pitt UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego so far waiting on ivy day haha Other information I would like to get involved in research ASAP ideally in freshman year I m planning on emailing professors early April after all my decisions come back though I may push the date back depending on how the political climate changes I have a fair bit of research experience already in microbiology plant molecular biology 1000 hours but I m looking to get into more neuro related lab work in college specifically concerning brain tumors or psychiatry Anyways here are what I think of the 3 schools I would really appreciate any insights from current students regarding UCSB specifically such as my majors opportunities things to watch out for etc Thanks a lot and sorry for the long post Pitt Molecular Biology Philosophy Pros Honors College priority registration advising BPhil degree option sounds really interesting Great for premed and biology has med school for clinical activities I ll probably get to live in my own apartment cheap cost of living no on campus living requirement Top ranked philosophy department Big hub for neuroscience research Lots of things to do in Pittsburgh museums restaurants etc On the east coast I lived in New York during middle school and really want to go back Cons Going through significant financial trouble NIH cuts hiring freezes etc very big red flag for me Somewhat less prestige lower ranking not a major factor UCSB Molecular and Cell Biology Philosophy Pros Regents scholarship perks guaranteed 4 years housing w first choice dorm rooms specialized advising Less competition for premed It s not a very popular destination for premeds from what I can find I vibe with the campus Also really great weather I can see myself transferring into the Creative Studies college for biology very early if I commit Basically a tiny liberal arts college with heavy focus on research from what I ve gathered Cons Party culture not really my thing In California I would be stuck here for 4 more years at least Not that well known for biology no med school Though I am aware of some clinical opportunities Does not have many researchers in my area of interest UCSD Molecular and Cell Biology Philosophy Pros One of the best schools for biology has a med school for clinical opportunities Lots of researchers in neuroscience Academic nerdy culture Overall prestige is highest possibly more opened doors Lots of opportunities for bio in SD Cons Only 2 years of guaranteed housing SD housing market seems brutal Lots of premed competition In California Significantly more expensive option compared to Pitt amp UCSB but still affordable 42k year vs 10k year for Pitt amp UCSB	3

I know the minimum gpa requirement is 3.00 (flat B grade across all). I’m feeling sad that I will be graduating after spending two years at ucsb as a transfer student which I want to explore the sb area a bit more. Plus, I love the way how ucsb has a very good overall ranking due to its remarkable reputation for classes as well as ta/professors’ research topics. My questions are: 1. What experiences have you had while taking pre-comm classes both positive and negative sides of it? 2. Those who were eligible for appeal process, what was the experience like and getting the email? 3. Those who did not meet the requirement and have to switch majors, how did you feel and what did the email quoted if you did not meet the major requirements? 4. Those who transferred in from a different department or those been at ucsb since first year, what was the reason to pursue in comm over your original intended major?

Can the government now directly slash SNAP benefits that students are on? Can they strip down medicare benefits to those on it? Can they defund fafsa or other parts of the dept. of education? Is there still any procedural process left that can stop the direct cuts of these social security programs?

As you know, not all students interested in applying to college can manage a campus visit.    A couple of us are thinking of setting up a free service to connect potential applicants with current students who are willing to speak to them for just 5-10 minutes (via a free voice chat).    Free means free for both prospective applicants and for any college student volunteers.  Yes, most colleges have a virtual option for prospective applicants to ""visit campus"" or hear from current students, but this would be with much less friction.  Good idea / bad idea?  Would you be potentially interested in speaking briefly with a prospective US or overseas applicant - at your convenience and from wherever you are on campus ?"

Your quarter may have started out with the best of intentions, beginning with that New Year's resolution to earn Dean's Honors, land that research assistant job, join a campus org, &amp;c.   Then life/health/academics intervened. It's happened to me more often than I've had hot lunches, I assure you.   However, you have options. I've written about them in this forum several times (e.g. see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1j0lq4c/welp_i_may_as_well_deliberately_fail_my_final_then/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1hfw1iz/got_bodied_in_chem_1a_now_what/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1hafnzm/gpa_damage_control/)). You may be able to drop a drop a course (with a W)--all the way up until Friday Mar 14. If things have really gone pear-shaped, maybe a complete withdrawal from the quarter is in order?  Need to take some time away from UCSB? That happens more often than you'd think, and the process of returning (next quarter? next year?) probably isn't nearly as cumbersome as you fear. And if you're a frosh or first year transfer student taking a grading optional class and wind up earning a C- or below, you could *retroactively* change the course to an NP some time in the Spring '25 quarter (this is ONLY if the course is grading optional; not available for letter-grade-only courses).   Keep your wits about you and problem-solve. And keep perspective. Your challenges right now, as grave as they may seem ATM, are passing in nature; take it from a guy who's seen a *lot* of sordid stuff. There are resources out there, and my [L&amp;S Advising colleagues](https://uged.ucsb.edu/advising/general-academic-advising) would be happy to work on a plan with you.   But you've got to take some initiative, too. *Bad news never gets better with age*.

I can stand and block more of a red curb with my feet than what my bike was blocking ffs. I appealed but I know they won’t even look at it. The appeal process itself is hilarious they make you put in your plate 4 times and citation number 2 times, login with a different account then Net ID, the whole shebang.

And I my problem is I want to do a undergraduate research, but the cfmar one is kinda hard for me to be get enrolled in since i'm not a fms major and I will only take 160A due to the pre requisite and time schedule. And if I do the 197 project, I will only have two classes at the Winter quarter and only 197c at the Spring quarter. (All the units are completed) My question is does the minimum unit requirement has to be at least 12? Can I apply for the deficit load for two quarters? Or only the last quarter? And is there any better method for me being in this situation???

Everything about the social atmosphere, location, and lifestyle at UCSB seems amazing - I’m just unsure how much prestige surrounds the UCSB name and what the career outlook is. Obviously it’s not considered a typical “target” school for finance and investment banking, but career development is important and I want to know if attending UCSB - as opposed to another, more Business-focused school - will decrease my chances of landing a good job out of college.

I need some advice on what to do? Should I tell my teachers since finals are coming up? I don’t want to lose focus or quit school but at the same time I know my mind might be in another place during these next few weeks. New financial responsibilities are also thrusted upon me since he has 3 little ones and my step mother doesn’t work and I don’t want to leave them abandoned. I plan on getting another job, probably another restaurant, so I’ll be working more but I want to still finish school.

It has a lot of sentimental value (it’s from a deceased family member), so I’d be super grateful if anyone spots it or picks it up. I retraced my steps from the Arbor to the tunnel 3 times and I couldn’t find it. I’m starting to get worried someone just picked it up and I won’t ever see it again. If some of you guys could just keep a look out for it I’d be really grateful.   I don’t even care if you extort me for all i’m worth please 😭😭. If you happen to see it or know anything, please DM me or comment here. Thanks so much!

The funding cuts are, without exaggeration, catastrophic to universities, like UCSB, that rely on these funds for major parts of their operation.  Moreover, junior and senior research scientists have been let go at the VA. Most schools have halted or limited students they admit for PhD programs and many universities have a hiring freeze. We will lose a generation of scientists in the US, a detriment to science in general to US's leadership role in science. More importantly, this science is what finds cures for disease, lays the groundwork for the next innovations.  I encourage you all to stand up for science tomorrow, either in DC or locally at Southern California events.

I can only do the TR one and so I put myself on the waitlist. However, as I'm an econ major I keep sinking down positions in the waitlist and am now 11th.  My original thinking was that since the pre-req is math 8 which is a challenging class (?), a lot of people that have enrolled may not pass their math 8 and will be dropped automatically after finals grades are released. But now I'm not sure if that's going to be enough for me to get in from the list anymore.  Any thoughts on this? Should I just wait and see/crash?

I’m currently taking the 2nd class for both series, there’s 3 total. Will take the last classes in the series next quarter (spring). However I’m not doing so good in them and I’m thinking I should drop one and retake it which will mean I’ll have to stay an extra quarter this summer to finish.  Will that impact my decisions offer?

One of the most infamous is from the Vietnam war, when some genius asserted that [""we had to destroy the village in order to save it.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_B%E1%BA%BFn_Tre) Don't be a boomer.  Crunch time is upon us (though it never really departs in the sprint that is a 10-week academic quarter). I'm already fielding questions from frosh/sophs if they should deliberately tank their last mid-term or final, to ""ensure"" they get a bad enough grade so as to be able to repeat the class.  The answer--in almost *every* circumstance--is a resounding no. I've written about this topic before, in this forum and [elsewhere](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjDqr6yO9wtkucKRSMoZ6BfTkDicYb6mloJ2jaDenVs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.762jr1yimo1q). Do yourself a favor and talk to an [L&amp;S advisor--qless](https://queues.ucsb.edu/) opens again Monday AM at 9--and explore your options.   If you gotta take the L, dropping with a W beats an F on a transcript. And depending on your circumstances, the odds are pretty good you can still drop that class you're bombing rn.

And you know what even tho she said there would be 3 groups presenting in the section, she took up some time taking attendance and stuff and when it’s our turn there’s NO TIME FOR PRESENTING. There’s like 10 minutes left and our presentation needs at least 12 minutes. I mean if you can’t fit 3 presentations in one section then DON’T ANNOUNCE IT IN THE EMAIL. I prepared it for 4 days and now you’re telling me I still need to be anxious for another 7 days while also preparing for another presentation just because you can’t manage class time wisely.  By the way a presentation can be at most 15 minutes and one section is 50 minutes so I think she should be taking over time presentations into account and leave that taking attendance stuff to the end of the class	The most painful section presentation TA sent us a email four days before our section telling us that we would be presenting this week and I was like oh it s pretty nice cuz I had another presentation next week And you know what even tho she said there would be 3 groups presenting in the section she took up some time taking attendance and stuff and when it s our turn there s NO TIME FOR PRESENTING There s like 10 minutes left and our presentation needs at least 12 minutes I mean if you can t fit 3 presentations in one section then DON T ANNOUNCE IT IN THE EMAIL I prepared it for 4 days and now you re telling me I still need to be anxious for another 7 days while also preparing for another presentation just because you can t manage class time wisely By the way a presentation can be at most 15 minutes and one section is 50 minutes so I think she should be taking over time presentations into account and leave that taking attendance stuff to the end of the class	13

1	2025-02-27 23:20:09	Political situation getting on my skin	As a Hispanic woman, I’ve been feeling really anxious about everything happening with our federal government. I can’t concentrate on my classes because they feel insignificant compared to the issues affecting me and those around me on a deeper level. I’m truly disappointed in this country, which I once praised for its rhetorical diversity, its promise of freedom, and the so-called “values” that made it great. I can’t sit in class and pretend everything is normal when it’s not, especially when people are being targeted.  It makes me sad how divided we are, and how so many people fail to realize that this isn’t just a Republican vs. Democrat issue—it’s turning into a class war. We have billionaires representing us under the guise of having the “best” intentions. Meanwhile, our president is selling visas for $5 million, an amount that not even upper-class Republicans or the richest UCSB students who voted for him will ever be able to afford. Sometimes I’m reconsidering my future goals and thinking to just leave the country, even thought I’m a citizen I don’t want to be part of this country with such a lack of empathy and ignorant people that are supporting Trump and Musk. We are regressing as a society instead of moving forward and its really scary, people are questioning the vaccines effectiveness putting our health system at risk, people are supporting someone that doesn’t believe in our climate crisis which is a fact and not a subject to discuss, they are being openly Nazi and no one is doing anything to stop it. They are targeting immigrants the same way Jews were during the holocaust. Trump is giving signs that he is a dictator and we are just letting this happens in front of us.

I am also open to go in a regular boxing gym if it is convenient and easy to reach from the Campus.    Note: I am a woman, so I would prefer an environment where I'd have to deal as little as possible with machism and paternalism, please.

No problem as long as they handle it well but it is still that lingering feeling of why do you as a yt person want to teach black studies ? Like why was that your goal. I think they failed to consider how students of color feel.  Like I understand educating yourself but that takes space from black people in higher education and as a person of color it's a little disheartening. Also the yt students in that class LOVE to speak like its rare when an actually student of color is able to speak. Also in my feminist studies class MEN love to act like victims. Like this man was rude as f to me today in class and I asked his homie wtf was his problem and he said well you hurt his feelings talking about his project. Like bruh he wrote "" it's loose"" as a insult towards women in his project portraying women running from harsh gendered words HOW AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO LAUGH and then he drew a woman kicking a man off of a ladder  HOW WAS I NOT SUPPOSED TO LAUGH ITS FUNNY. And therefore because I had offended him over a week before he felt justified in calling me aggressive because I giggled and somthing he said and then asked if it was the name of the article he was holding. Like shit dawg sorry I'm autistic and awkward but I don't think that warranted such hostile micro aggressions. Like how was me saying oh that's the name aggressive. Also his friend IMMEDIATELY started like speaking down to me when I approached. Like I said ""it was around 10 years ago"" and he was like "" actually it's 11"" like omfg dawg that's such man behavior.

If anyone has done it before or knows how it works, I’d really appreciate your help!  In my home country, a general health check-up usually includes a blood test and various screenings to assess overall health. I’m wondering if UCSB offers something similar.  Here are some questions I have:  * Does UCSB offer general health check-ups? If so, where can I schedule an appointment? * How much does it cost? I have UC SHIP—does it cover the check-up and any additional tests? * Is there anything I need to prepare before the check-up? * If I want blood tests and a full health screening, do I need to request them separately?

1	2025-02-18 22:29:14	To the bike thief, I despise you.	Someone stole my bike from the dlg bike rack, just about an hour ago.   So here is the full story. I normally parked my bike at a bike rack in front of a parking lot. I drove to campus everyday and rode my bike to classes. However, this morning  when I got here I realized that my lock was not working. I couldn’t unlock it like I used to do, but after some yanking, I somehow managed to unlock it. Then I can’t lock it back. The lock was kind of old so it’s probably just worn out and I didn’t really suspect anything. I planned to buy some lubricant to see if it could help but otherwise I would just buy a new lock. Still, I had to go to classes first so I just rode to the class without locking my bike. Then I went to dlg to eat afterwards, also without locking. I knew it wasn’t ideal but what am I supposed to do, right? I had to go to classes first. But after I was done eating, merely 20 minutes later, my bike was gone. I thoroughly looked through the bike rack but the bike was nowhere to be found. It was gone.  I don’t know who did it. I don’t know if it’s a student or some non-UCSB personnel. It’s just so beyond me that someone would steal a bike in the middle of the day like that. I don’t really care at this point. To the thief, you are no worthy human being. I mean it.

The reason I believe it’s a pi phi date is that this guy was dressed in a suit, walking towards bills bus with a group of girls and guys also in similar formal attire. I was driving on 66 Trigo when some guy (white, curly hair… doesn’t narrow down much) gave me a thumbs up as if asking to hitchhike. I thought it was just a joke but shook my head when I thought maybe he was being serious. He clearly didn’t take that, because he got in front of my car so I couldn’t leave while still holding the thumbs up. I kept inching towards him but did not touch him and he moved, but as I was passing he tried to grab at my car door handle and open it to get in. Thankfully they were locked but even when I passed him he started sprinting after me. Now I know pi phi isn’t gonna take accountability or do anything because it’s not one of their sisters doing this but I’m not entirely sure what to do from here. Do I make a police report? Does this even warrant one? Can I report it to Panhell or the school? If anyone has an idea, please let me know. I don’t want him to think this is okay and try to do it again in the future.

If you see someone matching this description please avoid them and if you see someone trying to help them please do your best to calmly notify them of the potential danger.

"No one I know irl seems interested and/or aware enough to talk about this so I'll just say it outright: the current administration is essentially attempting a coup in which power is concentrated in the executive branch and all other federal institutions are dismantled and sold for parts. In less than a month, Trump and his billionaire buddies have ILLEGALLY dismantled and gutted several federal agencies and installed inexperienced loyalists as the heads of others. So many of his EOs are explicitly unconstitutional but SCOTUS (filled with his appointees) has said he cannot be held accountable for ""official actions"" so I guess that doesn't matter anymore. Chaos is already spreading in this country and it will not be long before we all feel its effects.   Is anyone else losing their minds over this? Like here I am studying to get a job designed for a world that is disintegrating before our eyes. What's my degree gonna do when the economy depresses/collapses, or all our personal info (collected by Musk) is leaked? I am seriously struggling to see how anything I do here matters considering our entire country is at stake. And don't even get me started on how tech billionaires want to dissolve America into network states run like corporations (watch if you need convincing: https://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=Jlsx9N7hVZlng3QZ)  I'm not a protester, have never protested, and honestly don't even know where to start. All I've realistically done is sit in silent panic as I watch these events unfold. So I'm definitely not intending to call out anyone here for doing nothing or being lazy or whatever. Im just yelling into the wind, trying to see if anyone else feels the same. There's gotta be something more we can do here than shut our ears and pray everything turns out ok, right?"

My group has ran into some complications regarding housing since we started searching, so the one offer we recently got would cost $1200 a month per person, not including utilities, which is definitely something my family cannot afford. I’ve called the fin aid office and they told me even with my rent being high, the quarterly refund check should be able to cover it and I’d actually be saving more money instead, but they were unable to give me an estimated number. I just wanted to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and how much of your rent/other living expenses was covered by aid! For reference, my SAI is in the negatives. Thank you! :)	Off campus financial aid Hello I m currently a first year at UCSB and am planning to live in an off campus apartment in IV for the next school year My group has ran into some complications regarding housing since we started searching so the one offer we recently got would cost 1200 a month per person not including utilities which is definitely something my family cannot afford I ve called the fin aid office and they told me even with my rent being high the quarterly refund check should be able to cover it and I d actually be saving more money instead but they were unable to give me an estimated number I just wanted to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and how much of your rent other living expenses was covered by aid For reference my SAI is in the negatives Thank you	25

To give you an idea of what we play, we play rock like The Beatles, The Cranberries, Radiohead, as well as a fair amount of modern pop like Chappell Roan and Mitski. We're looking to add keys to our group because a lot of the songs we want to play happen to have keys in them.  Some songs we'd like to incorporate keys into: Don't let me down, Just like heaven, Nobody (mitski), etc.  So if you know how to play keys and also wanna be in a band, HMU. We practice \~2 times a week, but that is variable. all that we ask for is a good attitude and some chords &lt;3.

With Valentines Day coming around the corner I’ve been starting to notice a lot more couples on campus. Being a transfer student, this didn’t really used to bother me but now I feel this sense of “singleness”. And the worst part? Having a crush on a straight guy. It’s like setting yourself up for disappointment; kinda like this feeling that you can’t have what you want with them, yk?

40	2025-02-10 07:20:42	For anyone considering CALPIRG or doesn’t know what it is (don’t waste your time or money)	"this is from someone who was apart of calpirg some time right after 2020. i have a lot to get off my chest with this one.   ⁃ first the pledge drive, it’s basically a scam. most people at least now pay $10 a quarter to calpirg, and that’s said to go to resources, political power, and staff training. however the majority of this money (~70%) actually goes to the national pirg organization and does not get given back to the statewide orgs. there’s actually so little money going into funding these big events that are planned that campaign coordinators at the statewide level have to literally pay out of pocket for things calpirg should reimburse. this is just the money aspect, and that’s not even the beginning of their shady financial practices. but besides money, half the time, the pledge promises don’t even actually happen. we make promises that we as calpirg will make a change and help a bill get passed when in reality calpirg purposely pledges on bills that are 95% sure to get passed so that it looks like we have a bigger impact than we really do. in actuality, lawmakers have worked on these campaign bills for years before we actually pledge on it, and we will decide to pledge on it only when it looks like the bill is being passed soon, acting like we had a big impact in the decision. sometimes the bills we pledge on end up not being passed when we want it to, and no one will address the fact that we basically made people pay $10 on a promise that we did not keep.  ⁃ the “calpirg formula” is bullshit. they always say to recruit, train, and track. they start with tabling to get more volunteers, which makes sense. then they phonebank to invite people to these events, but they need people to phonebank, so they phonebank people to phonebank, which wastes SO much time. the majority of the time is spent just trying to get people to show up to only recruit more people to show up. the retention rate for volunteers is so abysmal that they need to keep recruiting. so much time is put aside for recruitment alone that almost no time is given to flesh out big events, and most of the time it’s a scramble to get an event done. most orgs finish recruitment by week 3, but with the pledge drive that calpirg does, recruitment really doesn’t end till week 6, which only gives those on the quarter system 3 weeks to get a big event fully planned out.   ⁃ now on a larger scale, we aren’t actually making social change, we’re just being used as a “pretty face” to make it look like young people care. no one in this org will ever actually get to do the juicy grasstops work because they don’t expect you to actually care about the bills we’re advocating for. for example, when i had question about a bill (don’t remember specifically, but it was a fast fashion bill), they got agitated and said “dont worry about it, we have ‘experts’ who deal with the specifics.” by the way we never get to find out who these experts are and what they even do for this organization. even the organizers who get paid to help the volunteers don’t know what they do. they blindly trust these so called experts and expect us to blindly advocate for these bills without asking too many questions. we’re just supposed to be the young college advocates.  ⁃ the favoritism is so bad, not only in each individual uc calpirg, but also statewide calpirg. the organizers will choose whoever they like despite their skill level. someone who is more qualified for a higher position will often lose it to someone who is favored by the organizers. i thought this was just an issue within our chapter, however after talking with other schools during state conferences, i soon realized that it’s an issue with every school. unqualified people are getting privileges just because they’re more outgoing or fun to be around.  ⁃ speaking of statewide conferences, they are extremely unorganized, and as far as i know they’re still very unorganized today. the organizers who get paid to literally organize the conference cannot budget properly, and it ends up being an issue for the rest of the student volunteers to deal with. a lot of the times these organizers will blame the students for the conferences not going as planned, when in actuality they should take accountability and maybe change the way they approach organizing. if the same methods keep failing, it’s stupid to think that things will change when you aren’t willing to change.  ⁃ as a whole, MOST people working for calpirg in the higher up positions above organizers are in it to line their pockets.   ⁃ calpirg does not support unionizing, and andre dellanttre (senior vice president of public interest network) vocally advocated against it during the obama administration. this basically aligns with the fact that all full time organizers get paid below minimum wage, and they can’t do anything about it or else they risk losing their jobs. the HIGHEST paid organizer gets paid $30,000 a year as reference.  tldr: calpirg sucks the life out of you. you don't make any genuine change statewide, you're just a posterchild for shady ""activism"" practices. go join any other activist group on campus."	For anyone considering CALPIRG or doesn t know what it is don t waste your time or money this is from someone who was apart of calpirg some time right after 2020 i have a lot to get off my chest with this one first the pledge drive it s basically a scam most people at least now pay 10 a quarter to calpirg and that s said to go to resources political power and staff training however the majority of this money 70 actually goes to the national pirg organization and does not get given back to the statewide orgs there s actually so little money going into funding these big events that are planned that campaign coordinators at the statewide level have to literally pay out of pocket for things calpirg should reimburse this is just the money aspect and that s not even the beginning of their shady financial practices but besides money half the time the pledge promises don t even actually happen we make promises that we as calpirg will make a change and help a bill get passed when in reality calpirg purposely pledges on bills that are 95 sure to get passed so that it looks like we have a bigger impact than we really do in actuality lawmakers have worked on these campaign bills for years before we actually pledge on it and we will decide to pledge on it only when it looks like the bill is being passed soon acting like we had a big impact in the decision sometimes the bills we pledge on end up not being passed when we want it to and no one will address the fact that we basically made people pay 10 on a promise that we did not keep the calpirg formula is bullshit they always say to recruit train and track they start with tabling to get more volunteers which makes sense then they phonebank to invite people to these events but they need people to phonebank so they phonebank people to phonebank which wastes SO much time the majority of the time is spent just trying to get people to show up to only recruit more people to show up the retention rate for volunteers is so abysmal that they need to keep recruiting so much time is put aside for recruitment alone that almost no time is given to flesh out big events and most of the time it s a scramble to get an event done most orgs finish recruitment by week 3 but with the pledge drive that calpirg does recruitment really doesn t end till week 6 which only gives those on the quarter system 3 weeks to get a big event fully planned out now on a larger scale we aren t actually making social change we re just being used as a pretty face to make it look like young people care no one in this org will ever actually get to do the juicy grasstops work because they don t expect you to actually care about the bills we re advocating for for example when i had question about a bill don t remember specifically but it was a fast fashion bill they got agitated and said dont worry about it we have experts who deal with the specifics by the way we never get to find out who these experts are and what they even do for this organization even the organizers who get paid to help the volunteers don t know what they do they blindly trust these so called experts and expect us to blindly advocate for these bills without asking too many questions we re just supposed to be the young college advocates the favoritism is so bad not only in each individual uc calpirg but also statewide calpirg the organizers will choose whoever they like despite their skill level someone who is more qualified for a higher position will often lose it to someone who is favored by the organizers i thought this was just an issue within our chapter however after talking with other schools during state conferences i soon realized that it s an issue with every school unqualified people are getting privileges just because they re more outgoing or fun to be around speaking of statewide conferences they are extremely unorganized and as far as i know they re still very unorganized today the organizers who get paid to literally organize the conference cannot budget properly and it ends up being an issue for the rest of the student volunteers to deal with a lot of the times these organizers will blame the students for the

So I’m graduating this year, and instead of doing senior pictures, (at the risk of sounding super vain) I thought it would be fun to get a portrait done of me instead lol. I’ve always loved the style of this pencil sketch of Charlotte Brontë, but an actual painting would be cool too (esp with the darker background).   I’m not super familiar with the pricing on this kind of thing (especially because I kinda want to sit for it live and in person for the full ~experience~), so maybe all I can afford is a pencil sketch 😅… but if you’re a student and artist here and would be down to let me commission you for this, please comment your art Instagram/portfolio!!

Some context, I went to Purdue for my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. This is within the ECE department over there. I think Purdue's ECE department is stronger in terms of coursework and research. How much does that matter for an M.S. degree? I don't think I would get research opportunities here at Purdue due to the sheer amount of students in the program and I'd be starting at UCSB at a clean slate. It also seems that they cost the same amount somehow.  How strong is UCSB's ECE Program? I want to focus on more hardware topics(ASIC, firmware, and computer networking) and I think Purdue is stronger in that regard. I don't see much unique course offerings by UCSB, but I assume the recruiting for companies here is way stronger than at Purdue given my experience there.   As for the social life and area, obviously UCSB is better, but I'm not so much a party person so I wonder if it would matter in the end going to Purdue vs UCSB.

1	2025-02-08 09:13:51	How to report bullying at UCSB	I am a current UCSB student and I am facing bullying from two of my roommates that are also both UCSB students which is severely impacting my mental health. We are not living in the resident dorm as we rent outside so I couldn’t talk about this to a RA. Me and two of my roommates often had conflicts daily however, recently they came together and started to actually bully me. Both of them all know the fact that I have serious depression and currently taking medicines everyday in order to maintain my mental status. With this being said yesterday when we are arguing they have used sexual rumors that were made about me during the last quarter to attack me which actually made me sad. They know the whole story about this rumor but still decided to use it and tell me that it is my own fault that I made these friends and I deserve to have these sexual rumors. They have also recorded the time specific to minutes of when I leave the room everyday and when I come back. This is actually making me concerned as I don’t know what else have they recorded about me. I have already rent another place and currently paying the rent for two places at the same time however, they are still bullying me. They told me to fuck off and I did do that, I am currently living at the other place and today when I got back to the original room to take my stuff they just commanded me to take out the trash while I do not even live there anymore. I just wanted to get away from them so I took out the trash but afterwards they just continued to bully me and said the things about sexual rumors. I am in a really bad status right now and I want to know if there is any way to report this to the university or just stop them from bullying me. My housing contract for the room with these two people is until September meaning that I would have to pay 7 more months of extra rent. I am willing to do that but even this is still not working as they are still bullying me online. Can someone please give me advice on what I can do? Thank you.

I got roughly a C- on it and to end with a solid B I would need to get at least 95% on the next test which I honestly don't know if I can do. I already emailed Dr. Nguyen asking about past curves and she said it was rare for it to ever be more than 1% so I can't rely on the curve either.   I am a BioPsych major hoping to go pre-med, dental, or nursing and I really don't want the possibility of another C on my transcript. I already have 2 from CHEM 1A and 1AL from my freshman fall quarter (I was very unprepared for college-level chem). I called the academic advisor and he said if you think you won't get the grade you want you can withdraw leaving a W on the transcript but I'm also afraid that during the interview process for post-grad stuff they will see that as a point against me.   If I were to withdraw I would take it during Summer but I don't know if the class layout (in-person lecture, online tests) would be the same. Another thing is that I'm currently a full time student with 12 credits but if I were to withdraw it would leave me at 9 and I don't know how that will impact schooling. I'm not on any grants or scholarships and I am paying out of pocket, living off campus.      TL;DR Is it worth withdrawing from EEMB2 to probably get a better grade in summer or try to finish EEMB2  this quarter and most likely end up with a high C or low B? Also, what are the possible consequences for post-grad for a W on a transcript?

While I have previously browsed reddit for information regarding the program and its curriculum, there is not much information about first hand alum or current participants experiences. While I can probably reach out to reps through the UCSB site, I curious about opinions off the schools website. Since (I think) the program is relatively new, there isnt much data about post graduate experiences as well. If you've done the program, any advice or reflections you have that would've enhanced your experience?   Moreover, during my undergrad, I focused on studies more than social life. While graduate studies will be more challenging and time consuming, I do want to be active in recreation/interest groups and create a community or social life. I know outdoor activities are big here.   Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Or links to other things that might aid in this like for off-campus housing etc. Ill be going through the Bren website in depth. I just want to be as prepared as I can be and start on the right foot as I havent been academics for a few years.

Though I passed Chem 1A with a decent grade I feel as though the amount of stress and anxiety that course created was more so than the average person.   I went to an academically rigorous high school and was always in this sort of flight or fight academic mindset (in that i study aggressively for hours at a time until i have nothing left to give). As I have grown I realized that it isn’t healthy but I feel like I can do well in classes without having unhealthy study habits.   This past week I have been studying for a Chem 1B final and decided to try a more healthy approach to studying (not breaking down and tweaking out to the point that my friends worry about me) and I feel so unprepared.   I am most anxious about the fact that if I don’t do well in Chem 1B (basic chemistry) how am I supposed to continue on to Ochem?  I guess I am just looking for reassurance: Does everyone feel like this?  Is it possible to pursue a Pre-Health career if I am not exceptionally good at Chemistry. Can I pursue Pre-Health with B’s and C’s?  Have other Pre-Health students failed a core class/midterm??  Sorry this was so long but I am anxious.

I had been seeing a girl here for a few weeks now. Unfortunately I’m pretty sure I caught an STI from her as she was the only person I was seeing, and I had been tested before I was with her.  I’m pretty frustrated because I’ve never caught one before. I had asked this girl a few times about STI’s when we first started having sex to make myself feel better and to clear up any doubts. Up until a certain point we were having protected sex but she insisted on me going raw recently. Any other people with similar experiences here? Also how is student health with this type of stuff? How have you approached someone that passed an STI to you?

While there is the call service to have someone walk you home, I think there should be more visible security presence on campus. I'm not sure what the exact policy is regarding police on campus versus in Isla Vista, but if it's not possible to have police, maybe there could be foot patrols. We need to reclaim the night! People shouldn’t have to feel scared walking home at night in one of the top universities. For a university that prides itself on being diverse and inclusive, it falls short when it comes to keeping its students safe in many areas. I recognize that many individuals are making efforts to improve this, and I don’t want to discount those efforts, but I truly believe a lot more can and should be done.

To park one's own truck and sleep in it?)  So the only option left seems to be trying to just park on a street somewhere. Any ideas? For a few days, in two weeks. Just for visiting a student.

My car was sideswiped in 18 Mesa Parking Structure (Floor 2, near the Rec Center side) on Thursday, January 30th, sometime between 11:10 AM and 3:19 PM. I was parked in spot #1304, and it’s very likely that the car in spot #1305 hit mine. The car that hit me was white.  Unfortunately, there are no security cameras in the lot, so I’m hoping someone might have dashcam footage from passing through the area. If you parked nearby or drove past with a dashcam during that time, I’d really appreciate it if you could check the footage.  Any help would mean a lot! Feel free to DM me if you have any info.

We have a website that we sell on, however, oddly enough they sell SUPER well on FB Marketplace and OfferUp. I want to expand to selling nationwide on these platforms, but I can't because if I make multiple posts for the same product Facebook will flag it as a duplicate listing. People are also hesitant to pay to have them shipped because there are a lot of scams on marketplace. Our solution is to build up a nationwide network of resellers who we will sell to at wholesale pricing and they will sell the signs on their own at regular pricing and they keep the difference (about 50% of the selling price) We will only have 1 or 2 resellers per city/metro area to avoid over saturating the market. If consistent, I estimate a reseller of our product can make around 10k in profit per year selling these. I understand it may not be much in the long run, but for a side hustle that would little time, why not take advantage of what I'm offering? Message me if you're interested and I can get you an interview with our team.

I also did not do so well in Econ 5, and need to even retake Econ 3A.   I decided to be an Econ and Accounting major on a whim because I had done the prerecs for it and accounting is essentially a guaranteed job, but even when I lowered my studying load to 14 units this quarter, this test grade is making me reconsider if even retaking 3A is worth it. These are the only classes I would need to switch into Econ right now, just not econ and accounting.  I seem to just not understand the material fundamentally and it's making me feel really stupid, but after going through all the trouble of going to this school, it just seems like such a waste to throw all of the work Ive done out the window to switch to a new major. My parents were already kind of mad at the fact that I had gone to this school in the first place, so if I switch majors, I feel as though they would be really disappointed.  Also, if I do switch, I would need to consider what job opportunities are out there, what would be able to support me, what classes I would need to take, and how much more schooling would that force me to do. I just don't know what to do. And if I do decide to switch majors right now, and drop the econ classes this quarter, I would be below the minimum unit count needed to get financial aid.  Any suggestions on majors that switch easily from Econ (or for that matter, English because that is what I am trying to minor in), or advice in general on what actions I should take would be appreciated.   I don't know what to do.

1	2025-01-28 20:40:20	Spring scheduling issues as a Zoolgy major	Hello hello, I’m having some issues with scheduling for the Spring as a 4th year Zoology major. I’m hoping to graduate this June, and fell a bit behind the proposed schedule during my 4 years here so I’m cramming a lot of my upper divs during my 4th year, and am fully prepared (and partially expecting) to take summer courses to finish my major. It’s been ok so far, but I’ve run into an issue for Spring. As a Zoology major, both EEMB 116 and 120 are part of the core curriculum, both of which I’m planning to take in the Spring. I also need TWO courses from Section C, Regulatory Biology/Behavior Emphasis, one of which I took in the Fall (EEMB 157A). I was planning on taking EEMB 138 for the second course in that category, but it heavily conflicts with EEMB 116, as well as EEMB 120. I could take 120 over the summer, but 116 I don’t think is offered in the summer. So, I don’t think I can take 138, but I still need a class from that section in order to complete the major. EEMB 157A and 157B both fulfill that section, but 157B is only offered in the Winter quarter and I think it’s too late to sign up for that now. I checked and EEMB 157C fits in my schedule, but isn’t listed under that section. Do you think it’s possible to petition the Bio Department to let me take that course in place of 138? I attached some pictures of my proposed schedule and the one with 157C instead, as well as my major sheet (orange is Fall, blue is Winter and pink is Spring). Thank you for reading this if you did, I'm just stressing and hoping the department will let me take something in place of the 138 to fulfill my major requirements and graduate this year, I'm fine staying for the summer but I'd really rather not stay for an extra Fall, Winter or Spring quarter if I can avoid it.

Do the PhD students need to switch schools (withdraw from UCSB, then apply to other schools) since changing PhD majors is not allowed without submitting another graduate school application?  I remember in Spring of 2012, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCSB admitted too many PhD students, so in the 2012-2013 school year, not every PhD Chemistry student could join a research group.	What happens when a PhD program at UCSB or any other school enrolls too many students for their PhD program where the principal investigators cannot accommodate all PhD students into their research groups Do the PhD students need to switch schools withdraw from UCSB then apply to other schools since changing PhD majors is not allowed without submitting another graduate school application I remember in Spring of 2012 the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCSB admitted too many PhD students so in the 2012 2013 school year not every PhD Chemistry student could join a research group	9

Last quarter, my group sent out a survey hoping to get insights on the transfer student experience here at UCSB and we'd like to hear more from you all. We added questions to hear about specific problems that you ran into during your transfer process, how you fixed them, who helped you if anyone did, etc.   A personal example of a problem I ran into: Before coming to UCSB, I earned an associate's degree in comm studies from my community college, but the comm department would only accept the 8 classes I took to count towards the Comm 1 pre-req.   If you had problems that you ran into, we're very interested in learning about them.

I'm only taking one film class this quarter atm (pre-major here) and while I love it, i personally don't think it's enough. I'm part of REALITY, 70+, Screen Writer's Room (all great clubs btw) and hope to get into DKA next year. But (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe that's all the Film related clubs on campus? If that's the case, I want to start another Film club, one that serves as a hangout environemt for people who are passionate about Film. I'm not really interested in production or making movies (we have REALITY and DKA for that) or screenwriting (refer to the Writer's Room). I was thinking of a club where we speak freely about any movie, tv show, a topic/news story in film they're interested in, a new skill they learned that involves Film (e.g. I'm learning how to write screenplays and want to share with others resources and books that have helped me so far - something like that). I also thought about playing games like trivia (there's this game called BUZZ! I have on the PS2, and if you don't know it, look it up; it's a lot of fun :) and any other games people can come up with. We can screen movies as well (I understand we have 70+ for that but SO FAR, it seems like the club only screens specific movies they vote on AND have access to) but I want more involvement and engagement with the film we screen together, whether it's on campus, at a house/apartment, a theater etc. SO, now I ask... 1) Who would be interested in joining? What do you think of the ideas I listed for the club?  2) If you are interested, what are some other things we can do in this club? 3) What should the name of the club be?

My original plan was to take phys 6a-c plus all of their labs to get the 12 units required for list b science electives, but this quarter, I was able to get phys 6a in pass1, but by the time my pass 2 came around, the labs were filled up. Because the phys6 series classes are only 3 units each, i most likely have to take another list b science elective on top of the phys6 series, to meet at least 12 required units. I realize that I probably should have taken the 7 series, but I didn't realize the 6 series labs would fill up so quick.

I get pretty good financial aid, and I wanted to know if the rates for on-campus housing are accurate. It says anywhere from 880+-1k for rent/month but is that the case? does financial aid also go towards housing/rent as well, do you have to pick up a meal plan? For that matter, is there anyone I can talk to about these things? Thanks for your time and responses.

1	2025-01-23 01:11:55	Are we doing something?	As a current student, I’ve been thinking about how I was told during my first year about the legacy and efforts of past students to fight for spaces like the SRB, which was built to support minority students and create a more inclusive campus. Their fight was a testament to how student activism can result in meaningful change. I heard Embarcadero Hall used to be a bank and students set fire to it.   With Trump’s recent executive orders, I feel like this is another moment in history that demands a student movement. Are there any protests, demonstrations, or manifestations being planned on campus to show that we, as a community, oppose these new policies? Similar to the encampment a couple months ago that brought a lot of attention to the issue. Trump’s new executive orders are a threat to multiple communities not just immigrants but women, LGBTQ+, environmental activist, let alone democracy. Why aren’t we acting on it?  It feels like now, more than ever, we need to come together and take a stand. If anyone knows of something happening or is organizing an event, please share the details here. As a university we have the duty to represent our generation and apply the education we have been receiving to make a change.   Let’s honor the legacy of student activism at UCSB and set an example for future generations.

1	2025-01-22 21:42:05	The Problem with the Koegel Autism Center and Autism Research Generally	I’ve noticed an increasing trend of arbitrarily invoking Autism to explain someone else’s person and behavior. The issue is that as present research seeks to normalize Autism, it also normalizes the pathologization of otherwise neurotypical behaviors. This leads to unfounded speculation on those that would not want to be viewed as having a disorder. Even worse is that assessments at institutions like UCSB’s Koegel Autism Center are not generally covered by insurance:  “Assessment costs at the Koegel Autism Center range from $798 to over $3,000, and limited financial assistance is available for those who qualify.” Even worse is that researchers within these institutions assume that what they are doing has no consequences: An accurate diagnosis with regard to autism is absolutely crucial, so that people can get the support that best fits their needs,” said Dr. Krasno. “This can be life-saving, affirming, and validating for people with autism.”   The field of psychology has already been doomed for some time, and it continues to find ways to pathologize normal variations in human existence for personal gain (i.e. publishing, grants, more patients). The fact that we have an entire institution within ucsb dedicated to this is deplorable.

I’m currently a first year looking at career paths and I’ve been seeing that accounting is being largely taken over by AI and job placement a few years from now will probably be much worse.

I’ve looked into the Tech Management certificate, but I don’t know if that would be enough. I’ve also looked into a data science minor, but I’m about to finish the 34 track and I would have to go back and start math over. It also seems like a huge work load.

1	2025-01-22 19:25:37	PSY 106 Overview	"I call upon all students who are in this subreddit who have taken Intro to Neuroscience with Dr. Scudder (PSY 106).  I have taken this course before a while ago where I sadly had to pass/no pass the class because I was 0.5 percent!!!!!! away from getting a C instead of a C-.  I asked for any other credit option or retaking quizzes, did whatever I could and never got a response.  Incredibly Disappointing.  I took some time to focus on other classes related to my major and now I am back in PSY 106 and they integrated alot of new things to help like ULA's for example.    Although the one thing that I have heard so many times about this course...Is the ""Applied"" aspect of her teaching.  You see it on ratemyprofessor you hear it everywhere.  I'll spare the details.  But the main point is that no matter what she seems to put on her slides..  No matter how specific she tries to make it.  It has pretty much no relation to what her exam questions are like.   The question I come to ask is **How can someone in her class study effectively and figure out how to understand the applied aspect of her course?** How can I and hopefully others who came to this reddit post with the same questions learn to get ahead and feel prepared for her midterms?  In case all else fails.  My study plan is just a hell ton of **REVIEW** and Dr. Scudder does her best to help with this and you can find it all on canvas.  After lecture find time after to **review your notes and perfect them and make it understandable to you.**   Use external tools and watch 2 Minute Neuroscience on youtube to replenish knowledge that she makes sure to have on her canvas.  Im serious, like watch it three times within an hour.  Review and use the quiz questions and take the practice problem set.  Its similar and as long you understand how the questions are phrased then you can atleast get an idea of what is to come.    For the double sided sheet of notes.  Do Not write just vocab.  Prioritize drawing the diagrams and know how they work and label what each piece does to the brain and what its responsible for. **Understand and memorize the pattern of how it works**   Use the key take aways to review and write extra notes.  If you cant seem to remember then write it on the double side of notes.    For ULA's prioritize the sessions at the end of the week.  They really do want to help how ever they can.    Hopefully this helps someone who was just as confused as I was back then.    If anyone else has other things to say then chime in and comment.    Good Luck."	PSY 106 Overview I call upon all students who are in this subreddit who have taken Intro to Neuroscience with Dr Scudder PSY 106 I have taken this course before a while ago where I sadly had to pass no pass the class because I was 0 5 percent away from getting a C instead of a C I asked for any other credit option or retaking quizzes did whatever I could and never got a response Incredibly Disappointing I took some time to focus on other classes related to my major and now I am back in PSY 106 and they integrated alot of new things to help like ULA s for example Although the one thing that I have heard so many times about this course Is the Applied aspect of her teaching You see it on ratemyprofessor you hear it everywhere I ll spare the details But the main point is that no matter what she seems to put on her slides No matter how specific she tries to make it It has pretty much no relation to what her exam questions are like The question I come to ask is How can someone in her class study effectively and figure out how to understand the applied aspect of her course How can I and hopefully others who came to this reddit post with the same questions learn to get ahead and feel prepared for her midterms In case all else fails My study plan is just a hell ton of REVIEW and Dr Scudder does her best to help with this and you can find it all on canvas After lecture find time after to review your notes and perfect them and make it understandable to you Use external tools and watch 2 Minute Neuroscience on youtube to replenish knowledge that she makes sure to have on her canvas Im serious like watch it three times within an hour Review and use the quiz questions and take the practice problem set Its similar and as long you understand how the questions are phrased then you can atleast get an idea of what is to come For the double sided sheet of notes Do Not write just vocab Prioritize drawing the diagrams and know how they work and label what each piece does to the brain and what its responsible for Understand and memorize the pattern of how it works Use the key take aways to review and write extra notes If you cant seem to remember then write it on the double side of notes For ULA s prioritize the sessions at the end of the week They really do want to help how ever they can Hopefully this helps someone who was just as confused as I was back then If anyone else has other things to say then chime in and comment Good Luck	14

To give others and I an overview about the class and mainly how to prepare and study for the midterm and final cause that is what actually matters.  I found an archived post about this same class where students three years ago discussed the class and expressed concern about the amount of information being given, test questions not relating to anything we are shown in lecture, people not having time to finish essays etc.   e have 2 lectures a week and have to watch a number of lectures to watch known as ""Norden Lectures"" that teach you a lot about neurobiology and how the brain and certain systems work.  Still the same process from previous years of this course.       So...how can a student like me get ahead and study effectively for this course?      I haven't taken the midterm yet and so far I like the course since I myself am a psychology brain science major.

1	2025-01-20 19:26:19	UC Santa Barbara vs. Cal Poly SLO	"Hey all, if anybody has some insight or experience relating to my current predicament I'd really appreciate some advice. I'm a transfer student finishing up my second year at community college, and need help choosing which school to transfer to in the fall, between either UCSB or Cal Poly.   I'm a business student who wants to major in Finance, which importantly, only exists at Cal Poly. UCSB does not have a business/finance major so I'd have to go into economics which is somewhat related but not the same.  Money and distance are not factors in my decision. They're both roughly the same distance from where I live and will cost me around the same amount to attend.  Some things I am worried about besides the whole major thing, is my ability to get a job after graduation. I've heard that Cal Poly is more ""hands-on"" and helps you prepare for a career while the UC's are more ""research based"". I don't really know what that entails but I just want to make sure that I have a job lined up after grad and don't have to move back to my hometown and be unemployed. Also, the prestige that comes with the UC name I've also heard is good. If anyone has insight on interning or career opportunities that either school offers, or if one has an advantage over the other, I'd appreciate the help.     Secondly, I want to go somewhere that's social. I want to build a network, I want to be able to easily make friends, and I definitely wanna make up for the lost ""college-experience"" that I didn't have these past two years at community college. I'm pretty extroverted and would be interested in joining a fraternity at either school I choose. I know both schools are social but I have a feeling SB takes the cake in that department.  If anyone has any important info that could help my decision like maybe about transfer housing or the overall transfer experience at either school, or anything related to business at cal poly or Econ at SB, I'd really appreciate it. Just trying to weigh my options and figure out what is best for me.

I also don’t mind living with random assignments but it definitely is a bit more scary.

The police officer was pretty clear about not going to court since I was with her but she is stressing out. The only thing the restorative justice program gets rid of is the open can charge.

Mostly making this to see if anybody's looking for friends on here, and because my TA told me to do so (if you're reading this thank you for the pep talk).   I haven't really made any friends since starting in the summer. I've been trying too, like going to clubs and shoreline events, but I haven't connected with anybody at these things. I'm also really introverted which I know doesn't help. This has been something I've really been struggling with lately, which I've been trying to change. I know I'm probably not the only person struggling with this too, but I'm also generally too scared to initiate conversations with people I usually see by themselves.   Incase anybody wants to connect over these things, I'm a first year Env s and Global studies double major, and I really love bands like Nirvana and Pink Floyd. My favorite hobbies are photography and rock climbing, and I also generally like going out to eat (I don't know what else to add). Even if we don't connect I'm down to just send memes, I have plenty to share.

Some questions that I have:  How is the dining and quality of food?  How is the location? What do you like and dislike about Santa Barbara?  How is social life? Are there a lot of events and opportunities to socialize?  What are they dorms like?  How is the English program?  What is like being an alumni?

I’m currently in IV. I know I transferred at an odd time (spring quarter) and I’ve been here for about a week and I’m stressed about making friends. I have roommates but I just don’t vibe with all of them too well and they’re all really close so I’m left kind of alone while they laugh in another room (literally happening as I type this).  A little about me I love to be outside and do almost all activities. I really love surfing, working out, crafts, and hanging with friends. School hasn’t started just yet so I have a lot of free time. I really wanna make friends with some fun surfer girls who just wanna do everything together (this is my dreammmmm lol).   I just feel like people my age already have their friends and aren’t looking for new ones. I know it hasn’t been that long but I’m still worried. I’m also pretty social but I get anxious and over think easily, so I don’t know if I can just chat with people and be like oh can I have ur number we should hang sometime! Like I fear that sounds desperate 😅. But I am a little desperate.

The problem is that writing is much to slow and tiresome to keep up with accelerated curriculum. I'm worried I won't be able to keep up the pace and it will end up being redundant.**  * **Laptop: I love the idea of having everything in one place, and I can type faster than I can write. But, I worry that the temptation of distractions (social media, etc.) might affect my productivity.**  **What do you guys think? Are there any benefits to combining both methods, or should I fully commit to one approach for this intense 8-week schedule?**  **Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

None of the amenities they offer actually exist!

That said, the only way I can get out of my contract as the office there instructed, was for me to transfer it to another student. That said, if anyone here is interested in staying here, just know that I am open to anyone at all to take up my contract. If you do, the office allows total freedom in terms of choosing your own personal plan (changing the room type, meal plan, etc.). Additionally, if someone does this with me, I will personally give them $200 (this offer only stands till the Thursday of this week). I am ready to explain more to anyone interested. please just comment here so that we can get into contact.

My current approach is to treat school like my job, meaning 9-5 focused on going to class or reading or doing assignments. Starting on assignments when they are assigned (instead of a few days before they are due). Letting go of perfectionism (will never have the perfect topic or thesis) and just making a decision and going with that. I want to have 1 weekend day where I do nothing for school, to relax my brain, and want to aim for having the complete weekend to myself. I am finding that I do better at school when I get more rest.  People who do this sort of thing with 4 or more classes, how do you do it? How do you stay organized, manage your time, and get shit done?  Not looking to destroy myself or cheat by using ChatGPT to write anything.

Bike Committee has heard your concerns and shares your commitment to restoring a bike path near the Interactive Learning Pavilion (ILP). The Bike Committee has been advocating for safe and efficient bike infrastructure in this area for years, and **we are excited to share that we have begun the formal process to design and implement a replacement bike path.**  After years of discussion with campus officials, we have been given their support to move forward with the next steps of the project. We have requested a design that will include a dedicated bike path between Davidson Library and the ILP, with roundabouts at the north edge of Lot 3 and a portion of what is currently the bicycle parking area just east of the ILP.   While this is a major step toward a safer, more efficient campus for cyclists and pedestrians, the project is still subject to further approvals and planning. If the project proceeds as expected, it will likely take several years to complete.  In the meantime, we urge all cyclists and pedestrians to prioritize safety and care for your campus community members. Please be especially mindful of high-traffic areas around the ILP; additionally, cyclists are encouraged to take the designated route on UCen Road, even if it is a little longer.  We will keep you posted as the project moves forward! Follow us on instagram for the latest updates: [https://www.instagram.com/ucsb\_bikecomm/](https://www.instagram.com/ucsb_bikecomm/).   For more context about the history of this issue, please check out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/13capwz/ilp\_bike\_path\_statement\_and\_survey\_from\_as\_bike/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/13capwz/ilp_bike_path_statement_and_survey_from_as_bike/)  And  [https://www.instagram.com/p/DCnfxJCvx\_b/](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCnfxJCvx_b/)  Thank you for your continued patience and advocacy.   Sincerely,  The Associated Students Bike Committee	ILP Bike Path Update from AS Bike Committee Dear UCSB Community The A S Bike Committee has heard your concerns and shares your commitment to restoring a bike path near the Interactive Learning Pavilion ILP The Bike Committee has been advocating for safe and efficient bike infrastructure in this area for years and we are excited to share that we have begun the formal process to design and implement a replacement bike path After years of discussion with campus officials we have been given their support to move forward with the next steps of the project We have requested a design that will include a dedicated bike path between Davidson Library and the ILP with roundabouts at the north edge of Lot 3 and a portion of what is currently the bicycle parking area just east of the ILP While this is a major step toward a safer more efficient campus for cyclists and pedestrians the project is still subject to further approvals and planning If the project proceeds as expected it will likely take several years to complete In the meantime we urge all cyclists and pedestrians to prioritize safety and care for your campus community members Please be especially mindful of high traffic areas around the ILP additionally cyclists are encouraged to take the designated route on UCen Road even if it is a little longer We will keep you posted as the project moves forward Follow us on instagram for the latest updates For more context about the history of this issue please check out And Thank you for your continued patience and advocacy Sincerely The Associated Students Bike Committee	44

The Mexican places are ok but Freebirds is grossly overpriced for how little meat they give you and Cucas tastes lower quality. The poke/asian places are quite lackluster for the pricing, and none of the sandwich shops are very good. Starbucks is low quality and overpriced, Hummus Republic is pretty good sometimes and has good value.  I missed a few places but the only truly good restaurant in IV is Naan Stop, hands down. I just really wish more quality restaurants would open in IV so I don’t have to drive to Goleta or Downtown just to get a quality meal.

It’s easy to park but once you do you need to get out of the car while holding your door to not hit the car next to you which tends to be pretty difficult. A few times I even had to get in the car from the right side and then squeeze to a drivers seat from there because someone parked too close to me from the left(I don’t blame them considering how spots are designed). I’m not a big guy so it’s not terrible, but I would guess it’s pretty difficult for bigger people.

The soonest the doctors could schedule necessary followup tests (to determine if I might need surgery) was the 8th, so I ended up missing my classes on the first three days of the quarter. I made the 5 hour drive down to school anyway (which was itself potentially inadvisable given my risks) and was ready for classes by the 9th, so most of my professors have been very understanding. However, in one class there was an assignment due by the 8th on Canvas for which I missed the deadline. I emailed the professor, explaining the seriousness of the situation that had kept me from my classes, and asking for an extension, but he said that he 'could not do that retroactively' and rudely insinuated that I was being foolish to miss so much of his class.   This assignment is only worth 5 percent of my grade but I would still rather not get a 0. More than that I am just somewhat miffed by his attitude given that I explained the unavoidable and serious nature of my circumstances in detail. Do I have any potential recourse in this situation? Is there any admin/department I could discuss this with?

(Also I understand this is just the first week, but I'm the type of person who constantly worries about stuff like this.)

We seem very close, but she doesn’t seem to want to help me out during class. She’s so sweet, but I have been having thoughts lately. My cohort is small, so it’s obvious we will see each other often.   By help, I mean:  - When I missed class and asked her if there was anything I should catch up on, she would lie to me and say there was nothing. It’s usually on the syllabus, but sometimes professors tell us to read or look up certain news to discuss for next class. I always have her back whenever she’s sick and misses classes, but she seems secretive. This happened twice.  - In two separate occasions, I needed help with a software to do my work and she lied that she didn’t know how to it. I later learned she knew the software very well. I always help her whenever she needed help with her homework or software. I’ve helped her more than I’ve asked her, which she always lied.   I’m just feeling a little down with superficial relationships. I don’t know if maybe she doesn’t want to help me because I always do better than her in classes and research. When we got drunk one time, she said a lot of things about the top student in our cohort. It surprised me because she’s always so sweet. 🥲 She was saying that he’s insecure and always acts like he’s the smarter. The tone came off as she wanted to bring him down. I’m feeling something is off because it’s usually the top student and me who get praised in our cohort of 8.

I’m a Promise Scholar, and the program informed me that university housing is not guaranteed this year, though I do have priority. They recommended that I look for off-campus housing as a backup. I wanted to ask how difficult it is to find someone to take over my off-campus apartment contract if I’m offered university housing later. Thanks!

My mom recently lost one of her jobs so financially we’ve taken a hit. I *need* to get the room &amp; board fee off my fees (fully cancel my housing contract) to reduce expenses. I’ve submitted a petition and a request and have talked to housing in person about it, and they told me I need to find a replacement.  Does anyone know any other way for me to gain exposure to find someone to takeover my housing contract? I’ve already posted it up on Facebook, the UCSB4Sale subreddit, and have asked around, even tried looking for websites or calling people from the USCB Housemate website thing. I’m running out of options and am scared that if I can’t find a replacement, I’ll have to drop and do CC to be able to afford having to pay the housing rent for the Winter and Spring term.  Any help would be appreciated, thank you for your time.

I was not able to make a good group of friends yet, unfortunately. Being in the undergrad apartments also has a lot of upsides (free laundry, location, and just convenience overall). But it greatly lacks in the social scene, unless you get lucky with roommates.  I don't know anyone right now because all of my friends graduated and I was out studying abroad this past fall quarter. I was thinking about making a move to IV (was thinking maybe somewhere like 68 DP if I can) and live there. But I have never done anything with apartment stuff other than university owned places, and I don't know how to manage the cost (I need to talk to the financial aid office about this).  Anyways, question is if it's necessary to live in IV to make friends. The people that live in IV, from what I have seen, are quite the social type. That's what I am looking for, along with cleanliness.  I appreciate any advice!

As I shut my car off, I hear a LOUD shriek coming from the slough/North Campus Open Space dirt paths. We stop and listen to make sure that the sounds we heard were real, and they sure were. The blood curling screams were of what sounded like a woman repeatedly yelling “PLEASE NO, STOP”, “HELP”, that was followed by several minutes of screaming and crying. As the shrieks moved deeper into the wooded area, the screaming became the most horrifying moaning and groaning I’ve ever heard in my entire life. All while this was happening, I dialed 911 and requested police officers to the scene. Many witnesses stood outside their home doors, and some on the sidewalks surrounding the entrance to the park confused and scared for what was going on in those paths.  By the time the police arrived, the shrieks had already stopped. They entered the paths and shone their lights for about 30 minutes before I had to go back home. I came back a while later only to find out that the scene was no longer occupied by the police, which brought me here, very disturbed and hoping to bring awareness to the situation in hopes to find our more about the situation, as well as to maybe ensure all of your close homies and acquaintances are okay.   I am aware that the path is frequented by runners and walkers at night, which may be a really bad idea considering the length and darkness of the course. I am also aware that the university has constant SA reports, which could be possibly be the case.  I am not sure what went on during those 10 minutes in that EXTREMELY DARK wooded area, but whatever it was has been etched to the back of my head, and has made me feel some responsibility to let you people know about the incident (since I haven’t seen anyone report it yet) to ensure the safety of you and your close ones now and later.

Currently im considering UCB, UCLA and UCSB for my top 3 choices but idk which one to put first!   Im a primary Life Sciences or Biology major (big on marine biology). I love nature and beaches and my friends would say I'm a loud and extroverted person (who can but dosent really like to drink that much). I also love playing sports like basketball (albeit nt that great at it). I hope to find and make friends with yalls if i come and be rather active with the student life.  Considering that this exchange is only for a quarter or a semester (depending on the campus), which campus would you say is more suited for me?   UCSB seems like the perfect place for me, coming frm a fast-paced country like Singapore i wanna chill and take life a little slower but im afraid i might nt be able to fit in or there isnt much stuff to do in SB...  I don't expect to experience greek life as from what ive heard its not the most receptive to asian exchange students (but i know nth abt that either ways).   Any help is appreciated!

Anybody know where that info would be? FAQs didn't seem to have what was looking for and to be frank, I don't even know what exactly I would type to find this.  Thanks.
