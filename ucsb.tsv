0.852509	Orientation questions..
0.852509	Hi everyone im an upcoming freshman student and I am signing up for orientation and I have a few questions.
0.852509	1. Is orientation at UCSB a 2-day process? Or do I just have to get there on the day that I signed up, and then leave after everything is done? (There is an option for staying overnight which is why I'm confused)
0.852509	2. Why does orientation cost money? Ik it briefly explains this in the website on why there are fees, but there is no reason as to why it should cost 300+ dollars right? Is there anything I could do to lower the cost at least?
0.852509	Sorry for the questions yall just a bit confuzzled. Any answer would help.

0.563748	A few years ago, as a demonstration of the power of a relatively simple technology, software giant Oracle built a cluster of 1,050 Raspberry Pi 3iPB+ computers.
0.563748	Now Oracle’s big cluster, the largest such assemblage ever built, has found a new home at UC Santa Barbara.
0.563748	The low-cost, low-power, credit-card sized machines are widely used, normally as individual units or in a small cluster of several units, to explore, learn and teach computing and programming, and to perform certain kinds of research-related computational tasks.

0.548162	Hello all, I just got off the waitlist at UCSB as an undeclared major and was wondering if you guys have any insight on the undeclared program and how good/bad it is. I’m currently at UCI but am leaning towards committing to UCSB. Thanks for the help!
0.543994	ucsb or cal poly slo?
0.543994	i’m currently committed to slo for journalism but i just got off the waitlist for communications at ucsb. ucsb has been a dream school of mine for years but since im already committed to slo im having doubts. i have plans to be a literary writer for a magazine or something like that but to be honest im really unsure about this. i feel like slo restricts my ability to “figure it out” because of their whole learn by doing motto. it basically means you take general and major-specific courses all four years, tying you down to your major like immediately. i also dont know if the “communications to journalist” pathway i’d follow at ucsb truly viable if thats the path i end up sticking to. ucsb will also be about 12k more for me. other concerns i have with both schools include the difficulty to get classes, dorm life, class sizes, connections, plus the party culture. are there a lot other social events to go to that aren’t just huge functions? i’d really really appreciate any advice or relevant information to help me make up my mind, thanks so much!

0.531545	HELP!! Summer Chem Courses at Community Colleges
0.531545	Does anyone know of chem courses (chem 1A and chem 1B) that can be taken at any CCs in the bay area or completely online? I've been trying to find one, but all the ones that I've looked at start in person before spring quarter ends.
0.525002	Looking for a subleaser for the summer, $850 rent for a double
0.524531	Thought it might be appreciated here.
0.523780	Should I fill out a petition to withdraw from one of my classes? (W on Transcript)
0.523780	So context, for basically more than half of spring quarter this year there’s been two things that have majorly happened to me that’s been really affecting how much and how well I can complete schoolwork.
0.523780	The first one being some of my financial information like my paypal account being compromised/hacked and having to deal with bank and financial problems that arose from that, leading to me having to deal with that tor a month and ended up deleting my paypal account. This event already sank my mental health into rock bottom and my anxiety sky high.
0.523780	The second major problem being that i suffered a concussion via a bike accident in the middle of the quarter that’s had to be treated for a few weeks now. Ive had to be taken to the hospital a few times now having to deal with said concussion and the lasting effects from it, while also treating other physical injuries on the rest of my body like deeps cuts and lacerations on my face specifically. The recovery process for the concussion is especially slow and requires me to not look at screens often which isn’t ideal considering we use canvas for basically everything now. And when i do try to work for extended periods of time i usually get awful migraines that make it especially hard for me to stand or walk, causing me to vomit.
0.523780	I’m mostly asking here first just to see and or clarify a few things:
0.523780	1. Should i mention both issues when submitting a petition to withdraw from one of my classes or just the concussion (as it does have physical paperwork attached to it)
0.523780	2. Are withdrawls counted as retakes? I’m a sophomore at the moment so I currently have zero idea of how withdrawls work or function or whatnot.
0.523780	3. If I were to apply for grad school would I have to explain why a W is on my transcript, and in the same vein does it make me look bad to have a W on my transcript in the first place?
0.523780	Any advice would be greatly appreciated regarding this topic, and i feel like my only three options are trying to tough it out and power through to try and make a comeback, intentionally fail and retake the class in fall, or submit a petition request like detailed above.

0.439277	CS Major requirements... nuked?😳24-25 GEAR
0.439277	So I've been advising a much younger friend of mine about courses in the CS department, and I noticed that the 2024-25 GEAR doesn't require new CS majors to take.... really anything in particular anymore 😱😱😱! So you can graduate the CS major without taking, for example, computer architecture or operating systems? Maybe even duck out of theory of computation(though ig it's still a prereq for like a dozen courses)? I'm sure students are jumping for joy at dumping PSTAT 120B in the gutter, though I suppose students affected by the above are not even aware of the horror they have narrowly avoided.

0.417660	Pre-major Reqs
0.417660	I have admittedly fallen a bit behind doing my pre-major classes (I am a second year PBS major), and will get them done during the summer session B. My first question is, will I be able to have my change of major petition go through by fall quarter? My next question is, with fall registration opening soon, will I be able to register for major classes that require full major status?
0.417660	To clarify, I have already scheduled an appointment with an advisor. Just wanted to see if anyone one here had an answer. Thanks in advance!

0.415855	Double Major
0.415855	I recently got into ucsb with a major in computer engineering and i cant wait to join in the fall ! Im super intrested in stats and I wanted to add it as a major. Would that be possible? My friend was telling me that adding majors (double majoring) at ucsb is really hard and i'd be really bummed if i had to take stats classes w/o getting credit for them as a comp e major. Also, how stressful would it be to double major? I really enjoy statistics but dont want to overload myself. Also, even if im a computer engineering major can I get research ops in the applied stats and datascience labs? sorry for all the questions!
0.415533	funniest/most interesting professors?
0.415533	Hey all- alum here (go gauchos etc) I wonder if any professors come to mind as particularly funny (at least just posessing a sense of humor)or particularly captivating(points for a combo!) from your time here (any major) (I was considering econ but honestly im pretty open) for an interview series im considering launching- Its a little daunting to simply look up random professors on rate my professor and a bit of a stab in the dark- I figured I'd go to the source- the students! Anyone come to mind instantly? thank you!

0.413146	uc davis or ucsb for premed
0.413146	i just got off the waitlist for uc davis for neurobio (an impacted major) and ucsb for pre psychological and brain sciences. i am on the premed track and im pretty stuck between these two. i am in the sac area and ive never really wanted to attend davis because its really close to home and on the other hand i know a lot of people from my school going to ucsb. the work hard play hard life and location of sb seems way better but i know davis is a premed school and they have an associated med school and plenty of hospitals in sac so the opportunities there would be better, but my heart is leaning towards ucsb. i talked to a premed friend at ucsb and she said there is opportunities there so its not like sb has nothing but im afraid that choosing sb over davis for premed is just like a dumb thing to do cuz theres prolly way more at davis, although, davis seems like they would have more competition to get opportunities because they have so many premeds. please give me advice 🙏🙏

0.412227	ucsb or ucla or uci?
0.412227	hello i’m a transfer student who got accepted to ucsb for econ and accounting, and was wondering if anyone could give their two cents on the major? i also got into ucla for business econ and uci for business admin. my career goals for the future is to get into accounting! i’ve heard really good things about the ucsb major it in terms of employment but wanted to know more or even about campus life!
0.412227	some pros and cons:
0.412227	ucla-pros •the name of the school helps to bring opportunities •the social life is a lot more accepting for transfers and i have friends who have said nothing but positive things about it •the location of the school is perfect, i’ve lived in la all my life so i know id enjoy living there and there’s more opportunities there as well •the school has a lot of school spirit which makes it have the “college experience”
0.412227	ucla-cons •have to pay about 2k out of pocket each year •not guaranteed business econ until completing pre reqs •heard weeder classes such as econ 11 and 141 are difficult and tend to have students fail out the major to econ or alt major •not guaranteed admission to the accounting minor either •would have to have have at least one roommate but was hoping to have my own place
0.412227	uci-pros •has an actual business school that would have people help guide me during undergrad •admitted into business admin and can emphasize in accounting •really good financial aid covering all the costs •oc is a very safe place with a lot of nice places to explore •would have my own apartment
0.412227	uci-cons •not as prestigious as ucla •the social life isn’t the best with people more focused on academics or themselves. •might have to work harder to find opportunities •doesn’t have the traditional “college experience” that i’d want after cc •not sure if business admin would be too broad of a major to get job opportunities
0.412227	ucsb-pros •has a lot of social life and the students are one of the happiest in the country •have heard of people in the major who got jobs straight out of undergrad •get to live on the beach and do many activities with the rest of the students •is a bit far from where i live which can allow me to grow a bit more independent •accounting will show up on my degree
0.412227	ucsb-cons •have to pay about 10k after financial aid •doesn’t also have the prestige that ucla does •might have to also work a bit harder for opportunities •doesn’t have a dedicated business school to help guide me throughout undergrad •not the biggest fan of the actual campus but still need to visit in person •i’ve heard about there being a lack of diversity •also some weeder econ classes such as econ 10a

0.410165	Genuinely don’t know how to make friends
0.410165	I’ve been going to clubs, trying to make plans with people, even tried going out by myself— nothing’s been working. I haven’t been clicking with anyone and it seems like I don’t really have friends here. I’m only a first year but everything is already so cliquey and it feels like I’m intruding on friend groups in the clubs and such. Sure I have floater friends but usually I’m always making plans and they’re either cancelling or just not making plans back. I’d like to think I’m not that annoying or standoffish or anything and I feel like I’m decently social and confident I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t have a friend group or even one or two close friends here. Even in classes I’ve been trying to make friends but it never goes outside of school work. I know it’s probably a lot my fault I think I’m doing something wrong and I usually only try to befriend people that look like someone I would get along with? Idk I don’t want to have socially peaked in high school and I miss having a friend group. My dorm hall is dead but there is someone I think is cool maybe I’ll knock on their door and ask to hang out idk maybe that’s weird maybe I won’t lol idk help

0.408065	We're coming up on the 11th anniversary. I've been on medical leave for this entire time because I haven't been able to work with this amount of sleep loss and anxiety. Does anyone else have these symptoms? It's weird that it manifested again after 10 years but I have the same fucking nightmare every single day, one hour of sleep, waking up sweating, stuck in my closet to calm the panic attacks because it's small and dark.

0.406745	Is UCSB really that bad for premed?
0.406745	Hello all; I'm an incoming freshman currently deciding between UCR and UCSB. I just visited both campuses and the vibe I got from SB was insane. I know UCR is the more sensible choice as I have a scholarship there and it's got a medschool but I couldn't imagine giving up the location &amp; ppl of SB (especially as a nature lover). I don't think SB will be just as good as UCR for pre med because R is definitely quieter and easier to focus at, but I'm realizing people are saying it's actually really bad for premed. Mainly in terms of avoiding distractions, but also bc how limited opportunities are. I heard that pre med opportunities and hospitals are really hard to get positions at because of how many other pre meds are there, and how few hospitals there are. I'm sure this part is at least a little true, but is it sizeable enough to give it up entirely and go to UCR? (Also I'm from NC so I find riverside campus/area pretty nice compared to where I live now)

Could current UCSB students, especially economics majors, share the pros and cons for UCSB. Also, if anyone knows what transfer life is like in UCSB, I'd love to know

0.400060	MS ECE 2025 admit, questions reg survival.
0.400060	Hi Gauchos, especially those from the ECE department!
0.400060	I'm an incoming international student to the department, but my decision to enroll is entirely contingent on how hard it is to get a TA/RA role—or any kind of employment or funding—that can make a decent dent in my student loans. This has been a lifelong dream, but I’m feeling jittery now because the current economic situation and the funding cuts are honestly pretty scary.
0.400060	So here are my questions:
0.400060	1. How difficult is it to get a TA/RA role in the ECE department as an MS student? From what I’ve seen in historical admit data (attached image) and the ~50 TA positions per quarter, it looked like almost everyone used to get one—until last year, when there was a big influx of admits. Is that influx going to make things harder for current enrollees? The admissions page does mention that incoming grad students are considered first, based on merit.
0.400060	2. About that “merit”—what exactly do they look at for TA positions? GPA?
0.400060	3. It’s surprisingly hard to find recent MS ECE students on LinkedIn (compared to other universities), even though the data shows there have been around 200 students in the past three years. Is that data even accurate?
0.400060	4. Are there any decent-paying options besides these? I may even drop the plan if I don’t seem likely to get anything. Or should I take a blind leap of hope, given the college reputation?

0.399135	Incoming Masters Student Questions

Does anybody have any advice on coursework I should study before starting the classes in fall? Anyone have any resources they recommend? Do professors take in masters students for graduate research positions? I've only seen them have PHD students.
0.399107	‼️Burning questions for UCSB student‼️
0.399107	Help! I was accepted off the waitlist for ucsb (am committed to UCSD but heavily considering swapping to SB). I have a few questions that I haven’t really seen addressed much and wanted to see if anyone could help!
0.399107	1. For upperclassmen mainly: I understand the campus isn’t really close to downtown sb or any truly urban areas. Have you found yourself bored now that you are older and could perhaps be over the partying/frat scene you may have enjoyed your earlier years? Is that kinda the only thing to do there or do you guys just drive to further away bars or something? And also like aside from any partying aspect, do you get bored in general like not having any close by malls or like typical movie theaters or whatever else, having been there so long.
0.399107	2. Kind of going along with my previous question: does the food get old quick? If other restaurants are far away and may require a car, does it get hard to find places you enjoy eating on campus. I overall haven’t heard much about the food on campus.
0.399107	3. Santa Catalina/FT dorms: I have heard that waitlist students are more likely to be placed here rather than the on campus dorms (although I have no idea the validity of that statement). For those who live there, do you find it isolating from the campus community? A big pro of ucsb for me is how everything was very close together (vs UCSD where all the dorms are very spread apart and not cohesive). So if you were placed in the off campus dorm buildings has that significantly affected how connected you feel to the school/campus. I have spoken to a girl that lives there and she said she doesn’t mind it but finds herself rarely on campus by choice like she only goes in the mornings for class and then leaves. Is that the common case?
0.399107	4. The beach: I always hear the beach as a big pro of ucsb and how it‘s lovely to live right by it. I currently live in small beach town in CA and am about a five minute walk from the beach which I love. However I have heard that the Santa Barbara beaches aren’t really the type you can hang out at or swim in or lay out on the sand. It seems most people just occasionally go to watch the sunset. San Diego has beaches similar to where I am from so it is what I usually visualize when I hear “beach school” but it seems to not really be a big aspect of SB if you can’t even really go there. Have you found this to be the case? Are there beaches with actual sand to like lay out on nearby?
0.399107	If anyone has anything to add regarding these things it would be a big help thanks!!

0.397060	UCSB vs UCI for CS
0.397060	Context: I’m a CS major admitted to UCSB, sent them my SIR. Was just accepted off waitlist at UCI also for CS and now have until this friday to SIR for UCI. Im very of an outdoorsy person(hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and especially surfing which i go 3-4 times a week) Personally not a party person too much and im definitely much more academic. Not gonna say im vigilantly anti party but definingly on the much lesser end of that scale. Im currently leaning towards SB, just because i visited SB and not UCI, though I could maybe visit this week unofficially.
0.397060	* Location. More scenic, visited last month, unlike anything I’ve seen in california; mountains right next to ocean, etc. * Social life, ppl seem more outgoing and just easier overall. * Smaller class size for CS or so im told * Stronger research wise?
0.397060	* party school reputation. I’m a core believer that you can find your people almost everywhere, but this is still somewhat of a factor. * farther from home(4-5hrs) * Worse surfing, somewhat of a factor for me but not defining. Its the main thing I do outside school. * isolated/industry connections, again this is a bit of a gray con. * housing crisis, goes for all uc’s but extentuated at SB. I was told that 2nd year housing should be looked at around November 💀
0.397060	* know decent amount of ppl going there, potentially have a good friend as a roomate. * Prestigiously stronger? IMO theyre both relatively the same but I thought I would include. * closer to home(1 hr) * better surfing * My dad works in irvine 3 days a week and has an apt there.
0.397060	* socially worse/more inactive. Again let me reiterate that I think you can find your own ppl everywhere, but I do believe it would be harder than UCSB but idk. * Larger class size * Seems more boring than SB, i’ve read its a commuter school rather than college town. * Less Diversity, decently important to me.
0.397028	UCSB Waitlist Questions
0.397028	I'm on the waitlist for CS.
0.397028	I was wondering if anyone has gotten off the waitlist for CS this year and if people are admitted from time to time by major or just randomly.
0.397028	I also saw that there's a place to submit transcripts but that's optional until you're accepted and decide to enroll. Would me submitting my transcript there mean that they get to see my senior year grades while reviewing my waitlist app again? (that would be a positive for me if they did.)
0.397028	Lowkey really hoping I get off this waitlist.

0.646304	Warning for University Housing Sierra Madre
0.646304	There is a construction of a town house/ apartment and it’s been going on the whole year. They work 7 AM to 6PM from Monday to Saturday. The sound of their drills and hammering will wake you up . The bantering in Spanish, the sing alongs… you will hear them all. “Adios Amor” in your face when you have a midterm tomorrow. The price is the same. The construction is 5 feet away from your balcony. You have been warned.
0.390949	Transfer housing question

0.390856	math gen ed credits
0.390856	can calc BC (2 course equivalent) and ap stats (1 course) fulfill the entire math gen ed (3 courses)? or can i only apply one AP test to that subject area?
0.390856	if i can only apply one, that means i'd have 2 courses done from calc bc and would need to take one more course. some online pdf says "Courses should be in a single discipline and should be sufficiently broad to provide a base of knowledge about the discipline." does that mean my third course has to be calculus based??? or can i venture out and try something like comp sci or data science?
0.600890	UMD vs UCSB
0.600890	I was admitted off the UCSB waitlist today for Computer Engineering and am unsure whether to take it over UMD.
0.600890	I have in-state tuition at UCSB, and a $15,000 scholarship yearly at UMD(provided I maintain a 3.2 GPA).
0.600890	At SB, I am directly admitted to Computer Engineering but at UMD I was admitted to L&amp;S(need a C- in chemistry and B- in physics and calc credits I already have to transfer). I am unable to take engineering related courses until I transfer.
0.600890	As far as I can tell research, internship and career opportunities are roughly equal.
0.600890	For me, my two main concerns are my classmates and peers. I know SB has a reputation as a party school and i'm not sure how true it is and how much it would affect me. But I tend to be influenced by peers and it would help to have friends that push you academically as well.
0.600890	The proximity to home is nice because I enjoy the scenery california has to offer but i've visited and would be okay with UMD, so I'd like to base the choice mainly on academic factors.
0.600890	Any advice/opinions would be appreciated.

0.388407	i hate my roommates
0.388407	So basically like I’ve kinda been fine with them since I started here. This is my first year btw. but then I got into an incident with one of them in which now we do not speak. My other roommate stopped speaking to me as well. They only speak to each other while im just here in my own world. I don’t mind it or anything but they have zero respect or consideration. Whether I’m trying to nap or sleep they always speak loudly and never shut up honestly. They are loud in the morning and it just pisses me off. I used to be considerate while they were sleeping but I can’t get the same respect back. Now I don’t care if they’re sleeping I’ll be loud. They’re a bunch of pussies honestly and I hate them. I wish I never had them as roommates in the first place. School is almost over but I honestly was considering on changing rooms just to get away from them. If I could I would literally throw hands but I can’t risk my education. Should I continue ignoring them or what?

It’s impossible to add any class right now so should I petition for deficit load or what? I have emailed OISS but I genuinely don’t know what else I can do now.

(p.s. yes ik a lot of people say you don’t need a car but my parents were saying they want me to be able to drive home if i need to asap (i live a couple hours away) and im usually the designated driver… but if i wouldn’t get the permit it’s not the end of the world lol)

0.374440	UCSB vs UCLA physics undergrad!?!?
0.374440	Hi guys. I'm currently committed to UCSB l&amp;s for Physics and waitlisted at UCLA for the same thing as well. I wanted to make this post to ask abt the physics program here so I can better decide between the two schools in case I am somehow admitted off the ucla waitlist. Some questions for physics majors or just anyone else who has input:
0.374440	1) How good are research and internship opportunities in SB? I understand that it is kinda a little far from bigger cities, so is there still a sufficient amnt of companies in the area that offer research/internship opportunities?
0.374440	2) Are lower division classes large? If so, is it still possible to connect with professors? Alot of ppl say to visit during office hours to make friends w professors... what exactly are office hours like?
0.374440	3) Would it be possible to double major or minor in smth like stats/data sci? I wanna have a fallback plan in case I don't pursue grad school, so I thought having courses in smth more practical would be maybe useful for getting a job right after my bachelors.
0.374440	4) Also considering trying to switch into college of engineering for mech or chem e... which is hard asf from what ive heard. If anyone has stories, advice, experience, or insight on this it would be much appreciated :)
0.374440	5) Any insight at all about if there are any big differences between SB and LA for Physics!

0.372795	Pitt vs. UCSB
0.372795	I recently got into both Pitt and UCSB for biology related majors. I plan to do premed and go to medical school and I am stuck between the two universities.
0.372795	I know Pitt has multiple research opportunities for premed and they have a great premed pathway. They also have challenging courses but the school culture is not too competitive. I love the campus and the environment but I am an out of state student so the cost will be around $60,000.
0.372795	Compared to Pitt I have heard UCSB does not have much clinical research and they also don't have a med school. However, I also like the UCSB campus and I am a CA resident so the estimated fees are less than Pitt, around $47,000.
0.372795	Would it be better for me to go to Pitt which has more research but is costly compared to UCSB which is closer and less costly? I know med school is extremely expensive and I don't want to start undergrad with a debt but I am also scared of not standing out because of less research and volunteering. Can anyone who has done premed at UCSB tell me your experience and if you would recommend it? Thank you!

0.356392	Do people play beach volleyball all day here?
0.356392	I am a transfer student who was recently admitted to ucsb and a couple other UC schools. While on a guided tour they took us past dorms filled with people playing beach volleyball and said this is a daily occurrence. While that does sound like paradise, my question is… do people actually just party and play beach volleyball all day? The way the tour guide advertised the school it made it seem like it was a very relaxed environment, and I am wondering about the academic rigor of the school. For context, when I went to UCSD to look at the campus everyone said it’s really rigorous and lowkey socially dead(lol). I’m wondering what the general work life balance is.

0.355867	CS and Linguistics (Language and Speech Technologies Emphasis) Double Major/Minor
0.355867	Hello! I am an incoming freshman that'll be studying Computer Science at UCSB. I recently came across the Linguistics major with an emphasis in language &amp; speech technologies. I am pretty interested in learning about linguistics, and I'd especially like to explore the intersection between Ling and CS. Thus, I am considering double majoring or minoring in Linguistics.
0.355867	Is anyone majoring in Linguistics with this emphasis? Or double majoring/minoring in CS? If so, I have a few questions!
0.355867	How would you rate the linguistics classes/professors here? Any classes you particularly enjoyed?
0.355867	How is the balance between pure linguistics classes and more technical/computational courses?
0.355867	How well does knowledge translate between CS and Linguistics? Do courses in both subject areas better your understanding of fields like NLP/Computational Linguistics?
0.355867	Would it be difficult to try to finish all of the requirements for both majors in 4 years? I have quite a few AP credits so would this help ensure this is possible/ease my course load?

0.354886	Noisy ass neighbors
0.354886	I live next to men. The walls are already so thin so I can always hear their conversations fully at night. For months since Fall, I can hear them playing video games together, which honestly I don’t care about. It’s always loud yelling but it’s a college apartment so I can’t complain on that part. What really pisses me off is them banging on their desks. One of them rages when he’s losing video games and starts slamming his door, banging on his desk like a maniac, yelling, and even bangs on the wall next to me so loudly that it shakes my entire room. It sounds like a body slamming all across the wall. This has been happening for months on end, and every time I report it to the RA, they just knock and say to be quiet. Gee thanks. To add onto that, when we pass by their apartment, it REEKS. Please send help haha.

Obviously I will reciprocate all of these things. I like to hang out with my roommates (hike, watch movies, get food, etc.). If anyone on here is interested in rooming lmk.

0.348529	And I just realized that it’s the only second choice major that isn’t engineering that I applied for at any school, and it might be why I got waitlisted? Because I’m being considered for the second choice?

0.332549	So I am a senior in highschool and was admitted to Computer Engineering at UCSB. However, in highschool the only AP exam so far I have passed is AP Psychology. I am now taking 5 additional APs, 3 which I am confident about but these other 2, AP Biology and AP Microeconomics not so much. I am now on a time limit on what to study. Can yall tell me please which one out of those 2 is best to study on and pass according to my major Computer Engineering (so like whats best to pass to either get GE's out of the way or to get more college credit)
0.332470	Advice: Changing Major as a Transfer Student
0.332470	I was accepted as a transfer student for this upcoming Fall for Pre-Financial Mathematics and Statistics, which was my second choice - Computer Science being my first.
0.332470	In the acceptance letter they stated that "You may remain in the major to which you were admitted or select from numerous other majors available within this college. Please visit the [Major Changes page](http://admissions.sa.ucsb.edu/major-changes) to view those majors. Unfortunately, you will not be able to change back into your original choice major(s) at a later date. Thus, if you accept our offer of admission, it should be with the understanding that you will benefit from the Pre-Financial Mathematics and Statistics major, or another available major within the college, rather than with the expectation of changing into the major(s) to which you originally applied."
0.332470	Does this mean that there is no likelihood of me being able to change to Computer Science as my major either now or later in the school year? I was hoping to be able to attend UCSB with my accepted major and take the remaining required pre-major Computer Science courses at UCSB, then try to change my major to Computer Science.
0.332470	I was also considering trying to change my major to Statistics and Data Science, as I read that it might be more closely tied to my coding background than Financial Mathematics and Statistics.
0.332470	If neither of these would work, do you guys have any suggestions for how I should move forward regarding this situation? I would love to be able to continue having CS in my future, as I've been working towards a CS degree while at my cc. Is there any way for make this work out where I could attend UCSB and also still be able to be in the coding field? I'm glad to take advice from anyone, current student or not.

0.331808	Should I go to UCLA or UCSB
0.331808	Hi everyone! I recently got admitted as a transfer student into UCLA and UCSB! I'm super excited and grateful but I'm having the hardest time deciding between the two.
0.331808	I got admitted as a gender studies major at UCLA which was my alternate choice (did TAP) while for UCSB I was admitted into communication which was my first choice. I'm honestly much more interested in communications than gender studies since even though it is UCLA, what would I even do with a gender studies degree? I did talk to an admission representative and she said I could POSSIBLY switch into sociology on orientation since I have 2/3 the requirements done (Socio 1 and stats). However I don't know if this is a guarantee and I really don't want to be stuck in gender studies.
0.331808	I'm also leaning way more towards UCSB because I love the location and vibes and I'm personally not a fan of Westwood as a college town. Isla Vista appeals to me more since it has that traditional college town feel. I'm also an LA native and grew up 20 mins from UCLA so I'm a bit sick of the area. On the other hand, there's still so many places in the city that I haven't explored yet since I usually only stay within my area and school, so maybe this will push me to see the city in a different way.
0.331808	Everyone around me is pushing me to go to UCLA because of the prestige and opportunities. I even talked to some of my friends roommates in SB and they said they're only there because it was a backup and they would've chosen UCLA if they could've. This would be a total no-brainer if I was in a competitive major like CS or STEM but I'm quite literally a Communication/Gender studies (or sociology) major so I don't know if that really applies to me. Is there a huge difference in opportunities given to UCSB students vs UCLA students in social sciences?
0.331808	I also found clubs on both campuses that I'm interested in, but I heard that the competitive environment makes it very hard to join the good clubs/students orgs (and also transfer discrimination????) at UCLA.
0.331808	TLDR; I honestly just don't want to regret my decision. I know I'd be super happy in UCSB since I already have my best friends there, but I know I'd probably be happy at UCLA too. Basically I'm torn between better vibes/atmosphere (UCSB) vs prestige, experiences (UCLA).
0.331808	Sorry if this is super long, but I appreciate any help and if you read any of this!! Anything is appreciate!!
