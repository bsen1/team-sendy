But it was a bubble built on speculation and investors buying stocks with borrowed money (&quot;on margin&quot;).  In late October 1929, the bubble burst. - Oct. 24 (Black Thursday): The first wave of panic selling. - Oct. 29 (Black Tuesday): The day of the total collapse. A record 16 million shares were traded as panic took over. Fortunes vanished, banks failed, and the world was plunged into the Great Depression.  It’s a powerful reminder of how financial optimism can turn to panic, and it changed American economics forever. https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1GJ8pEhunB/?mibextid=wwXIfr"

AAPL,"Apple lost a landmark lawsuit in London that accused the tech giant of abusing its dominant position in the app market by charging developers a 30% commission on purchases made through its App Store.  The U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled against Apple after a trial earlier this year. The case was filed on behalf of roughly 20 million iPhone and iPad users across the United Kingdom and seeks up to £1.5 billion ( $ 2 billion) in damages.  Plaintiffs argued that Apple’s App Store policies unfairly inflated prices for consumers and stifled competition among developers. Apple denied wrongdoing, saying its commission reflects the value and security of its ecosystem.  The decision marks the first class-action lawsuit against a major tech company to reach trial under the U.K.’s new collective action framework, with several other similar cases still making their way through the courts.  $AAPL"

The browser integrates ChatGPT directly into the browsing experience, allowing users to access AI tools without switching tabs or copying content. It also leverages browsing context, history, and past conversations to deliver more personalized assistance.  Currently available for Mac, with versions for Windows, iOS, and Android coming soon, Atlas resembles Google Chrome in design but introduces a powerful new feature called Agent mode. This capability enables the browser to perform multistep tasks—such as booking flights, shopping online, or analyzing data—by autonomously navigating websites.  During demos, Atlas successfully completed complex actions like creating shopping lists and ordering groceries online, though performance remains slow and occasionally clumsy.    $AAPL $SPX"

AAPL,"Demand for Apple’s new iPhone Air has fallen short of expectations, prompting suppliers to scale back shipments and production capacity, according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.  Kuo said on X that most suppliers are expected to cut capacity by over 80% in early 2026, with some long-lead components likely discontinued by late 2025. He noted that Apple’s Pro and standard models already meet most premium-user demand, leaving little room for new segments—just as previous Mini, Plus, and now Air versions failed to gain traction.  The analysis follows a Nikkei report that Apple is “drastically” reducing iPhone Air production orders and shifting focus to other iPhone 17 models. Apple shares fell 2.7% Wednesday after the news.  A KeyBanc survey also found “virtually no demand for the iPhone Air” and limited interest in foldable phones, analysts led by Brandon Nispel said. The iPhone Air was introduced as a lighter, more affordable addition to the iPhone 17 lineup.  $AAPL"

AAPL,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority confirmed on Wednesday the designation of Apple and Google as firms with strategic market status , paving the way for potential conduct requirements.  After reviewing feedback, the CMA concluded that both companies hold “substantial and entrenched market power” and a “position of strategic importance” in their respective mobile ecosystems.  The regulator, which consulted more than 150 stakeholders and held “constructive dialogue” with both firms, clarified that the designation “does not imply any wrongdoing” and introduces no immediate obligations.  However, it enables the CMA to consider “proportionate and targeted interventions” to ensure effective competition and fair treatment for consumers and businesses that depend on these platforms.  According to UK media, possible measures include requiring Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and obliging both companies to permit app downloads directly from developers’ websites.  $AAPL $GOOGL"

A $200 billion settlement would fairly compensate Neonode for back royalties, interest, and damages, reflecting the billions of Apple devices relying on this innovation. This is not just about money—it’s about respecting intellectual property and supporting small inventors who drive progress and innovation. Apple could benefit from tax deductions on settlement payments, making it a smart business decision. Settling now would save Apple from costly legal battles, negative publicity, and potential disruptions to product sales. Most importantly, such a settlement would send a strong message: no company, regardless of size or power, can use others’ inventions without fair compensation. Fair licensing protects innovation and levels the playing field. It’s time for Apple to do the right thing—pay fairly and respect intellectual property laws $NEON $AAPL"

AAPL,"$AAPL Analysts at Goldman Sachs &amp; Wells Fargo raised their price targets on Apple heading into the iPhone maker’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release. Apple is set to report earnings after the bell on Oct. 30. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target to $279 per share from $266. This revised forecast is approximately 6% higher than Apple’s Monday closing price of $262.24. Analyst Michael Ng expects Apple to post a beat on both the top and bottom lines. Specifically, he believes that Apple will deliver earnings of $1.81 per share on revenue of $103.5 billion, while consensus calls for earnings of $1.77 on revenue of $101.8 billion. Services revenue, a key metric analyzed by Wall Street, should also bode well, he added. “Services revenue growth (+13% yoy) should maintain momentum despite weakening App Store spending trends (+10% v. F3Q25 +13% yoy) on continued DD% momentum across iCloud+, TAC, AppleCare+, Apple Pay, and other subscription services,” he said."

AAPL,"Rumour: $AAPL foldable products likely delayed     Apple has been working on a foldable iPad (code-named J312) — projected to cost around $3,000 — for several years &amp; had most recently aimed for a 2028 release. But engineering challenges tied to weight ( test units of the foldable product weigh around 3.5lbs - roughly the same as a MacBook Pro), features &amp; display technology have pushed its potential debut to 2029 or later. Developing the technology for an 18&quot; foldable display has proven especially complex &amp; costly, pushing est&#39;d prices to roughly triple that of a 13-inch iPad Pro    Apple&#39;s first foldable iPhone might be pushed back to 2027, due to Apple taking longer to finalize certain design elements of the phone, such as the hinge &amp; other &quot;key specifications.&quot; 2026 release remains possible, but that production would be limited to only 5-7M units worldwide due to screen supply constraints"

AAPL,"Apple is reportedly encountering development hurdles with its highly anticipated foldable iPad, potentially delaying its debut from 2028 to 2029 or even later. The premium device, projected to be priced around $3,000, is facing engineering challenges tied to its weight, design features, and advanced display technology, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Apple is said to be collaborating closely with Samsung Display to develop an approximately 18-inch panel for the device. The goal is to minimize the crease typically visible on foldable screens, employing a display technique similar to what Apple plans for its upcoming foldable iPhone. Despite the delays, the project underscores Apple’s continued investment in next-generation form factors that could redefine its iPad lineup.  $AAPL"
